They have nothing to do with their relationship to the true value, and may have high precision, but low accuracy.  Numerical precision is the number of significant digits that an observation is recorded in and has become far more obvious with the advent of computers.  For example a database may output a decimal latitude/longitude record to 10 decimal places – i.e. ca .01 mm when in reality the record has a resolution no greater than 10-100 m (3-4 decimal places).  This often leads to a false impression of both the resolution and the accuracy."

As independently stated by Chrisman (1991) and Strong et al. (1997), data quality is related to use and cannot be assessed independently of the user.  In a database, the data have no actual quality or value (Dalcin 2004); they only have potential value that is realized only when someone uses the data to do something useful.  Information quality relates to its ability to satisfy its customers and to meet customers’ needs (English 1999)."

Uncertainty is a property of the observer’s understanding of the data, and is more about the observer than the data per se.  There is always uncertainty in data; the difficulty is in recording, understanding and visualizing that uncertainty so that others can also understand it.  Uncertainty is a key term in understanding risk and risk assessment."

Random error tends to refer to deviation from the true state in a random manner.  Systematic error or bias arises from a uniform shift in values and is sometimes described as having ‘relative accuracy’ in the cartographic world (Chrisman 1991).  In determining ‘fitness for use’ systematic error may be acceptable for some applications, and unfit for others."

The process may include format checks, completeness checks, reasonableness checks, limit checks, review of the data to identify outliers (geographic, statistical, temporal or environmental) or other errors, and assessment of data by subject area experts (e.g. taxonomic specialists).  These processes usually result in flagging, documenting and subsequent checking of suspect records.  Validation checks may also involve checking for compliance against applicable standards, rules, and conventions.  A key stage in data validation and cleaning is to identify the root causes of the errors detected and to focus on preventing those errors from re-occurring (Redman 2001)."

msgid "Data cleaning refers to the process of “fixing” errors in the data that have been identified during the validation process.  The term is synonymous with “data cleansing”, although some use data cleansing to encompass both data validation and data cleaning.  It is important in the data cleaning process that data is not inadvertently lost, and changes to existing information be carried out very carefully.  It is often better to retain both the old (original data) and the new (corrected data) side by side in the database so that if mistakes are made in the cleaning process, the original information can be recovered."

We picked-up from the work Rod Page started a few years ago. Similar work has been done by Gaurav Vaidya and the VertNet team with superb documentation. The Canadensys development team tweaked Rod’s code to connect to web services offered by the Global Names Resolver and the Database of Vascular Plants of Canada, each of which are high-performance services that accept scientific names in batches and produce responses containing full namestrings and hierarchies. Rod’s code was an excellent first pass, but we noticed that it could be made much more performant so we made a temporary service for the workshop and a temporary code repository. The Canadensys development team is contemplating a dedicated Open Refine service for the Database of Vascular Plants of Canada (VASCAN) and we’ve shared our approach with members of the Global Names project."

msgid "EasyOpen Redlist. An accessible method of querying the IUCN Red List, using a species list, the free software OpenRefine, and some pre-written code. Olly Griffin, July 2019. We often have a list of species - a checklist, or a set of species of interest for a project - for which we want to know the IUCN Red List category: Critically Endangered, Vulnerable, Least Concern etc. Manually searching the IUCN Red List website species by species would be slow for lists longer than 10 species, and practically impossible for a list longer than 1,000 species. I wrote a quick guide, link below, which shows you how to automatically return the Red List category, along with a number of other useful results, from the IUCN database using the free software OpenRefine to query the IUCN RedList API with pre-written code that works for any clean list of species scientific names. There is also a video which shows the process in action. I mostly use this for updating our long (900+) species list for KSWS. It can also be useful for research results, reports, publications, website data, national species lists, and anything where you’re dealing with a significant number of species. This process can be done in other ways – using R, for example – but this is an accessible method that requires no coding. I hope you find this useful. Please let me now if anything is not clear, and feel free to share with others who may also be interested."
