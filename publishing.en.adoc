=== Exercise 4
[NOTE.activity]
In this exercise, you will publish an occurrence dataset using the IPT.

Read <<scenario,USE CASE I>> (if you haven't already).

*Data publishing*

After cleaning the data in the Poales dataset, the team considers that publishing the data online through the GBIF network could be a good way to make this effort visible. You have been requested to lead that publishing work, based on the dataset.

. At this point, you need an account on one of the <<Training IPT installations,course IPTs>>. 
If you have not already been provided a login, please contact training@gbif.org and you will be provided with a login and password on one of the course IPTs.
. Download link:../exercise-data/UC1-4-poales-publishing.csv[UC1-4-poales-publishing.csv,opts=download]. (233.5 KB)
. Use the assigned IPT installation and publish this file.
. Use the previously downloaded exercise sheet to provide your answers.
