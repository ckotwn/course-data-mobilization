== Appendix: Data papers

[NOTE.presentation]
A data paper is a peer reviewed document describing a dataset, published in a peer reviewed journal. 
It takes effort to prepare, curate and describe data. 
Data papers provide recognition for this effort by means of a scholarly article.
We do not cover how to create data papers in this course, however, as an optional activity, you can watch this video (51:51) presented by Lizanne Roxburgh. 
In this video, you will learn more about publishing data papers.
