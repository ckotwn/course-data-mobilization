== Assessment and certification
[NOTE.objectives]
In this module, you will review the criteria to be used to assess assignments and to achieve certification.

Upon successful completion of the course and successful assessment of assignments (by trainers and mentors), participants have the opportunity to receive an official certification in the form of an https://openbadges.org/[Open Badge].

Uses data formats consistently and can use gazetteers, reference lists, or software-specific features to improve quality from the original. Documents clearly all changes and decisions taken in connection to data quality.
