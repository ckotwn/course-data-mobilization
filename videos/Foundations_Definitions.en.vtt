00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:07.910
This session is foundation work and part of
the Terminology section.

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:12.780
We will be introducing you to the language,
terminology and definitions for some of the

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:17.949
basic concepts, functions and processes that
you are going to be putting into use during

00:00:17.949 --> 00:00:22.160
the rest of the course.

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:27.310
First let’s review the structure of this
session.

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:33.120
In the section on DEFINITIONS we will first
try to clarify the use of the word “Data”.

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:39.100
We will then look at the terminology surrounding
Fields, Labels and Lists.

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:44.449
And lastly, we will straighten out some concepts
around characters and their mappings that

00:00:44.449 --> 00:00:47.559
will help prevent unwanted data messes.

00:00:47.559 --> 00:00:50.299
First definitions.

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:54.679
In this section we will look at some of the
many different terms and phrases that exist

00:00:54.679 --> 00:00:58.949
within the world of data and information management.

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:03.719
We will be using these throughout the course
and it is important that you be familiar with,

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:09.150
when and how to use them.

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:20.109
Let’s focus for a moment on some common
words and phrases that contain the word data.

00:01:20.109 --> 00:01:31.641
All of the phrases here include the word data,
but are they all the same, and if not, then

00:01:31.641 --> 00:01:39.560
what is the difference? Database, Database language, Database program, data cleaning tool

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:49.979
So, what is a “Database”?

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:57.310
There are many definitions, but what they
all have in common is the theme that a database

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:04.639
is a structured and organized collection of
data and/or information held on a computer.

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:10.190
Everything else in the list is just a way
to help you achieve this data nirvana!&nbsp;

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:14.980
Let’s dig a little deeper then into those
other terms.

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:20.600
Let us take a look at the phrase “database
language”.

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:26.510
According to the Oxford English dictionary
“language” is the method of human communication,

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:30.519
[…], consisting of the use of words [or
symbols] in a structured and conventional

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:32.129
way.

00:02:32.129 --> 00:02:38.120
For our purposes, database languages and their
close allies the array languages are the way

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:44.650
by which a human communicates with a computer
to manipulate and move around data.

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:47.080
Examples that you may have come across are:

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:52.239
Java, SPARQL, SQL and Python

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:57.879
They are simply methods used to define and
create tables, views and queries and also

00:02:57.879 --> 00:03:05.239
allow users to access, update, store and move
data around.

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:10.299
Now let’s look at the phrase “database
program or software”.

00:03:10.299 --> 00:03:14.950
Again going to the Oxford English dictionary
a “program/programme” is a set of related

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:19.660
measures or activities with a particular long-term
aim.

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:24.360
In this context, a “database program or
software” combines and presents functions

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:30.690
and features for manipulating data, together
is a unified interface.

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:33.540
Examples that you may come across are:

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:36.480
Microsoft Access, FilemakerPro and Oracle

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:45.019
So, database programs or software are grouped
utilities which allow a user, via a database

00:03:45.019 --> 00:03:54.920
language, to store, manage, query and report
data held in the system.

00:03:54.920 --> 00:04:00.900
The last term is “data cleaning tool”.

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:06.379
Data cleaning tools are systems whose utilities
focus is on the manipulation of data with

00:04:06.379 --> 00:04:10.359
the aim of increasing fitness for use.&nbsp;

00:04:10.359 --> 00:04:14.769
Examples that you may be familiar or will
learn about during the course are:

00:04:14.769 --> 00:04:17.600
OpenRefine, MatLab and spreadsheets

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:24.470
A data cleaning tool should assist the user
in the discovery and repair of messy data

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:30.660
in order to increase quality.

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:35.500
Continuing on with some more terms that you
should be familiar with we will look at the

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:44.390
differences between the terms Field, Label
and List.

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:50.810
You will often hear reference made to field
or column names and field labels or headings.

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:57.470
Often they will be used interchangeably, however
they are different things.&nbsp;

00:04:57.470 --> 00:05:01.310
Field or column names refer to the actual
column in the database table.

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:08.570
They are a often short, not always in plain
language, sometimes computer generated; but

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:13.860
in a properly formed database they are ALWAYS
unique.

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:21.190
Field names are almost always used by database
languages, because the avoid ambiguity.

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:25.611
Labels and headers on the other hand, refer
to the human readable versions of the field

00:05:25.611 --> 00:05:27.040
names.

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:32.620
Most often you will see these in the graphical
user interface of your software and on exports

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:34.570
and reports.

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:39.970
In some software you can in fact have different
labels to the same field on a user by user

00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:41.250
or group basis!

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:49.740
As 
you work with your data you will come across

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:54.700
the phrases “drop-down list” and “controlled
vocabulary” and on the surface they can

00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:57.030
appear to be the same.

00:05:57.030 --> 00:06:03.260
Indeed they are both powerful tools to help
you keep your data clean, but they are different.

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:09.720
A drop-down list, also sometimes called a
lookup table is a data entry element that

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:12.760
is created in your database software.

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:16.760
It allows to you select a value from a predefined
set of options.

00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:24.241
They can also be generated from the data itself
on the fly.

00:06:24.241 --> 00:06:29.130
A controlled vocabulary on the other hand,
is a very strictly defined, domain specific

00:06:29.130 --> 00:06:34.030
set of values that should be applied to a
particular field.

00:06:34.030 --> 00:06:38.560
They are an integral part of a well defined
standard.

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:47.810
Such values can be used in a drop-down list
as mentioned previously.

00:06:47.810 --> 00:06:58.030
In this section we will look at what the term
character means in relation to data and computers.

00:06:58.030 --> 00:07:04.880
As a reminder computers “see” in binary.
Everything that you type in, is held in memory

00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:07.240
as a series of ones and zeros.

00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:12.500
The computer does not “see” the repertoire
of letters and symbols on your keyboard.

00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:17.050
It needs a map to translate the character
set that you would write or type, into its

00:07:17.050 --> 00:07:23.390
binary language and then back again to show
it to you on the screen or a printer.

00:07:23.390 --> 00:07:26.430
This map is made up of two parts:

00:07:26.430 --> 00:07:29.360
The “coded character set”&nbsp;and

00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:32.090
The “character encoding”

00:07:32.090 --> 00:07:37.940
Each symbol or glyph is assigned a numeric
value and that number is then converted to

00:07:37.940 --> 00:07:43.240
binary.

00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:49.400
In this example we see how character encoding
is used to map the capital letter A in the

00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:52.410
western alphabet.

00:07:52.410 --> 00:07:59.050
The ASCII value for the capital letter A is
the decimal number 65

00:07:59.050 --> 00:08:02.710
which in HEXIDECIMAL is 041

00:08:02.710 --> 00:08:13.570
and in BINARY 01000001

00:08:13.570 --> 00:08:24.380
Try mapping your own name to Binary using
the link at the bottom of the screen.

00:08:24.380 --> 00:08:31.050
In effect what is happening is that when you
type into a keyboard and save a file the software

00:08:31.050 --> 00:08:35.649
that you are using will select an encoding
to save with it.&nbsp;

00:08:35.649 --> 00:08:40.750
When you open that file again the software
needs to know which encoding (map) to use

00:08:40.750 --> 00:08:58.509
to redisplay the information back to you correctly. This table shows you some examples of the more common character encoding and character sets.

00:08:58.509 --> 00:09:02.449
So why is this important to you as a data
custodian?

00:09:02.449 --> 00:09:06.949
Let’s say that you translate the start of
Hamlet’s soliloquy

00:09:06.949 --> 00:09:09.899
&nbsp;”To be or not to be, that is the question”

00:09:09.899 --> 00:09:17.430
into French and then save the file with a
text editor that uses the encoding Latin-1

00:09:17.430 --> 00:09:28.139
Then you send it to a colleague to check the
translation. Voila!

00:09:28.139 --> 00:09:34.100
When they open the file in MicroSoft Word
this is what they see…

00:09:34.100 --> 00:09:35.850
Mon dieu!

00:09:35.850 --> 00:09:39.399
There are some unexpected characters.

00:09:39.399 --> 00:09:45.690
You forgot to tell your colleague that you
where using Latin-1 as the encoding.

00:09:45.690 --> 00:09:50.589
MicroSoft Word on their end was set to use
the encoding set Unicode UTF-8.

00:09:50.589 --> 00:09:53.579
The maps did not match.

00:09:53.579 --> 00:10:04.730
Depending on the software the data may be
irretrievably corrupted.

00:10:04.730 --> 00:10:08.990
In review we have looked at the differences
between the phrases:

00:10:08.990 --> 00:10:18.600
Database; database language; database program,
data-cleaning tool; and also between

00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:26.080
Field names &amp; Field labels; Drop-down lists
&amp; Controlled vocabularies and lastly, we looked at

00:10:26.080 --> 00:10:29.300
Repertoires, Coded sets &amp; Encodings as they related to characters

00:10:29.300 --> 00:10:48.730
We've shown that although the terms may seem
similar they are in fact very different and the consequence of confusing them can be dire.

00:10:48.730 --> 00:10:49.730
Remember that:

00:10:49.730 --> 00:10:53.190
“..The first step in wisdom is to know the
things themselves.

00:10:54.639 --> 00:10:59.589
We often take for granted that there is a
whole language associated with biodiversity

00:10:59.589 --> 00:11:04.610
informatics that is not commonplace and has
to be learned.

00:11:04.610 --> 00:11:09.240
There is no shame in going back to basics
and getting to grips with the vocabulary,

00:11:09.240 --> 00:11:21.470
grammar and syntax just like with any new
language.

00:11:21.470 --> 00:11:26.730

This video is part of a series of presentations
used in the GBIF Biodiversity Data Mobilization

00:11:35.470 --> 00:11:40.050
course.
The biodiversity data mobilization curriculum

00:11:40.050 --> 00:11:45.490
was originally developed as part of the Biodiversity
Information Development Programme funded by

00:11:45.490 --> 00:11:48.139
the European Union.

00:11:48.139 --> 00:11:54.930
This presentation was originally created and
narrated by Sharon Grant with additional contributions

00:11:54.930 --> 00:11:58.379
by BID and BIFA Trainers, Mentors and Students.
