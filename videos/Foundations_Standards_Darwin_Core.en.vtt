00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:03.200
In this presentation,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:07.520
we will introduce you to data standards&nbsp;
as they relate to biodiversity data.&nbsp;

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:11.360
In particular, we will focus&nbsp;
on the Darwin Core standard.

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:18.000
The engineer and industrialist&nbsp;
W. Edwards Deming said:

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:23.280
“Standardisation does not mean that we all&nbsp;
wear the same colour and weave of cloth,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:30.000
eat standard sandwiches, or live in&nbsp;
standard rooms with standard furnishing.&nbsp;

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.600
Homes of infinite variety of design are built&nbsp;
with a few types of bricks, and with lumber of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:41.200
standard sizes, and with water and heating&nbsp;
pipes and fitting of standard dimensions.”

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.800
What he was trying to say is&nbsp;
that using standardization&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.880
does not prevent us from being creative.&nbsp;

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.520
He was also showing us that we already&nbsp;
live with standards all around us.

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:57.840
As we move forward, we will&nbsp;
define the term “Standard”&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:01.520
and we’ll look at how we interact&nbsp;
with standards every day.&nbsp;

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:06.320
We will then introduce you to&nbsp;
biodiversity information standards,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:11.840
including the Darwin Core Standard with which&nbsp;
you will continue to use throughout this course.

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:15.680
So what is a Standard?

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:17.600
At its simplest, it is:

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:19.440
“An agreed way of doing something.”

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.920
Standards are combinations of norms, conventions,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:27.600
specifications, requirements,&nbsp;
restrictions, and rules.

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:36.080
The main purpose for standards is to create&nbsp;
a framework of “mutual understanding”.&nbsp;

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:39.840
They should provide clarity&nbsp;
and help communication.

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:44.000
Examples of everyday things&nbsp;
that we encounter which make&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.280
use of standards to aid&nbsp;
communication of information are:

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:49.120
Units of Measurement

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:50.960
Numeral Systems

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:52.320
Alphabets

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:53.840
Languages

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:55.200
Emojis

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:56.800
Postal Addressing

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:58.720
Morse Code

00:01:58.720 --> 00:01:59.440
Barcoding

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.840
Let’s take a very specific&nbsp;
example and break it down.&nbsp;

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:13.840
Here in order to communicate accurately&nbsp;
and repeatedly a position on the earth – a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:21.840
latitude and longitude – is actually&nbsp;
a combination of at least 8 standards.

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:24.960
measurement - geographic coordinates

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:28.080
format - degrees, minutes, seconds

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:31.680
numeric system - sexagesimal

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:34.960
numbers - Indo-Arabic

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:37.040
language - English

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:38.800
alphabet - Latin

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:40.880
symbols - typography

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:42.880
font - Roboto

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:50.960
Standards provide ways of constraining&nbsp;
the array of possibilities.&nbsp;

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:55.440
In the earlier Foundations presentations,&nbsp;
you learned about types of data,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:58.800
schemas, formats and character encodings.&nbsp;

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.800
Each of these can be used to constrain the array&nbsp;
of possibilities within the terms of a Standard.

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:12.320
Types of data can restrict the values of a field.
So alphanumeric text in a text field,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:15.680
decimals in a float.
Yes/No in a Boolean.

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:20.800
An encoding schema can restrict&nbsp;
the range of values in a field.&nbsp;

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:27.680
For example, the list of possible latitude&nbsp;
values have a range: between -90 and 90.

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:33.360
A format can restrict the&nbsp;
representation of a data in a field.&nbsp;

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:40.720
For example, whether a data appears as year&nbsp;
month day, or day month year, or month day year.

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:46.560
And then, character encoding provides&nbsp;
the rules for interpreting bytes of data.&nbsp;

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:49.840
For our purposes, we’ll use UTF-8.

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:56.800
During this course, you will be&nbsp;
learning how to share your data.&nbsp;

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:59.840
As such, you will encounter&nbsp;
standards for transferring data.

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:06.240
An application schema, allows for the combination&nbsp;
of data standards for a specific purpose.&nbsp;

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:11.120
For example, using Darwin Core&nbsp;
terms within Darwin Core Archives.&nbsp;

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:14.880
We’ll delve more into both in just a few moments.

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:21.440
Again, you will make use of format, but this&nbsp;
time the format restricts dataset structures.&nbsp;

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:27.840
A dataset may make use of csv, xml, json and rdf.

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:31.920
And lastly, you will have a transfer protocol,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:35.760
which provides information on how&nbsp;
and where to send information.&nbsp;

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:46.800
These might include http (hypertext transfer&nbsp;
protocol), ftp (file transfer protocol), and smtp&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:50.960
(simple mail transfer protocol or&nbsp;
if you like, send mail to people).

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:59.520
In the domain of biodiversity informatics&nbsp;
there are many standards already available&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:05.120
that can help you work with your data.
The USGS has a very specific definition of these:
 &nbsp;

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:10.160
“Data standards are the rules by&nbsp;
which data are described and recorded.&nbsp;

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:14.080
In order to share, exchange, and understand data,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:16.880
we must standardize the&nbsp;
format as well as the meaning.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:22.560
The result of using these standards, where&nbsp;
appropriate, is that you will increase data&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:30.080
integrity, accuracy and consistency by clarifying&nbsp;
ambiguous meaning and minimizing redundant data.

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:36.000
Those that you are likely to encounter&nbsp;
or use on a regular basis may include:

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:39.200
Ecological Metadata Language Standard (EML)

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:41.440
Audubon Media Description (aka Audubon Core)

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:43.680
Global Genome Biodiversity Network(GGBN)

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:47.920
Ocean Data Standards and Best&nbsp;
Practices Project (ODSBP)

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:52.320
And last, but not least, we’ll spend the&nbsp;
rest of this discussion on Darwin Core.&nbsp;

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:58.560
The Darwin Core standard will allow you to share&nbsp;
your occurrence, taxonomic, and event datasets.

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:07.680
Darwin Core is a biodiversity standard developed&nbsp;
by the Biodiversity Informatics community.&nbsp;

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:11.040
It was originally developed under the Taxonimic&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:15.680
Databases Working Group or&nbsp;
T D W G, pronounced TDWG.&nbsp;

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:21.440
In recent years, the group has been&nbsp;
renamed, Biodiversity Information Standards.&nbsp;

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:26.000
But the acronym persists as the&nbsp;
community is quite fond of the name TDWG.

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:34.080
“The standard includes a glossary of terms (in&nbsp;
other contexts these might be called properties,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:40.240
elements, fields, columns, attributes, or&nbsp;
concepts) intended to facilitate the sharing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:46.400
of information about biological diversity by&nbsp;
providing identifiers, labels, and definitions.&nbsp;

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:52.000
Darwin Core is primarily based on&nbsp;
taxa, their occurrence in nature&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:56.400
as documented by observations, specimens,&nbsp;
samples, and related information.”

00:06:57.840 --> 00:07:01.600
So in short, Darwin Core is a “List&nbsp;
of fields and their definitions,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:03.680
as they relate to biodiversity data.”

00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:10.640
As we dive deeper into Darwin&nbsp;
Core or as it is abbreviated,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:14.560
DwC, you’ll learn it is more&nbsp;
than JUST a list of fields.&nbsp;

00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:19.120
We will use Simple Darwin Core&nbsp;
which is a predefined subset&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:24.240
of the terms that have common use across a&nbsp;
wide variety of biodiversity applications.

00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:29.440
This subset contains greater than 150 fields,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:32.560
that are placed into a set of&nbsp;
field classes comprised of:

00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:34.720
Record &amp; Dataset

00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:35.760
Occurrence

00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:36.720
Organism

00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:38.080
Material Sample

00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:38.560
Event

00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:39.920
Location

00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:42.000
Geological Context

00:07:43.840 --> 00:07:44.000
Identification

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:44.640
Taxon

00:07:46.320 --> 00:07:49.440
Additionally, there are two&nbsp;
auxiliary classes called:

00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:50.640
ResourceRelationship

00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:51.920
MeasurementOrFact

00:07:54.240 --> 00:07:59.040
From the Simple Darwin Core User Guide,&nbsp;
“Simple Darwin Core is simple in that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:59.040 --> 00:08:03.040
it assumes (and allows) no structure&nbsp;
beyond the concept of rows and columns,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:12.320
which might be thought of as attributes&nbsp;
and their values, or fields and records.”

00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:16.240
The DwC Quick Reference Guide will&nbsp;
soon become your go to resource.&nbsp;

00:08:16.960 --> 00:08:21.280
This page provides a list of all currently&nbsp;
recommended terms of the Darwin Core standard.&nbsp;

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:27.360
Categories such as Occurrence or Event correspond&nbsp;
to Darwin Core classes which group other terms.

00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:33.520
We now will look at some&nbsp;
examples of Darwin Core terms.&nbsp;

00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:37.040
The quick reference guide, consistently displays&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:37.040 --> 00:08:42.000
each term with the identifier name,&nbsp;
definition, comments and examples.&nbsp;

00:08:43.120 --> 00:08:48.240
The first terms we’ll review are Country and&nbsp;
CountryCode within the Location category.

00:08:50.640 --> 00:08:54.560
Generally, data holders have a field&nbsp;
for country within their source data.&nbsp;

00:08:55.280 --> 00:09:00.320
But often this data can be quite messy with&nbsp;
misspellings, abbreviations, and historical names.&nbsp;

00:09:01.280 --> 00:09:04.720
However, it is one of the most&nbsp;
easily standardized pieces of data.&nbsp;

00:09:05.680 --> 00:09:10.880
As noted in the comments, the recommended best&nbsp;
practice is to use a controlled vocabulary&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:10.880 --> 00:09:13.440
such as the Getty Thesaurus of Geographic Names.&nbsp;

00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:18.720
A controlled vocabulary places restriction on&nbsp;
the values that should be used for that term.

00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:25.760
CountryCode is a term that is&nbsp;
generally not present in holder data.&nbsp;

00:09:25.760 --> 00:09:30.080
But again, it is another field that&nbsp;
can easily be supplied with data&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:30.640 --> 00:09:38.080
due to the recommendation in the comments&nbsp;
to use an ISO 3166-1-alpha-2 country code.

00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:44.800
GBIF strongly recommends the sharing of&nbsp;
CountryCode within occurrence datasets.&nbsp;

00:09:45.360 --> 00:09:47.520
Sharing of Country is also encouraged.

00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:52.240
You will learn more about the GBIF requirements&nbsp;
and recommendations in later sessions.

00:09:56.080 --> 00:10:00.400
The next term is basisOfRecord.
basisOfRecord defines the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:00.400 --> 00:10:06.080
nature of each record in a dataset.
BasisOfRecord follows a controlled vocabulary.&nbsp;

00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:11.040
You can choose from PreservedSpecimen,&nbsp;
FossilSpecimen, LivingSpecimen,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:11.840 --> 00:10:18.720
MaterialSample, Event, HumanObservation,&nbsp;
MachineObservation, Taxon, or Occurrence.&nbsp;

00:10:19.760 --> 00:10:23.520
GBIF requires basisOfRecord with&nbsp;
published occurrence datasets.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:33.200
The last term we will review is occurrenceID.
When publishing occurrence records,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:37.360
GBIF requires an occurrenceID.
An occurrenceID is an identifier&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:37.360 --> 00:10:41.280
for the occurrence itself, not the&nbsp;
digital record of the occurrence.&nbsp;

00:10:42.320 --> 00:10:47.360
Recommended best practice is to use a globally&nbsp;
unique identifier otherwise known as a GUID.&nbsp;

00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:50.080
In the absence of a GUID,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:50.080 --> 00:10:54.880
a unique identifier can be comprised of&nbsp;
other identifiers within the dataset.&nbsp;

00:10:55.760 --> 00:10:59.840
For example institutionCode,&nbsp;
collectionCode, and catalog number.&nbsp;

00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:04.960
We call this a triplet.
There are tools on the internet that can&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:04.960 --> 00:11:10.080
help you to generate GUIDs for your records.
If you use this method, these GUIDs should&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:10.080 --> 00:11:14.160
become a permanent field within your&nbsp;
source data identifying each record.&nbsp;

00:11:15.120 --> 00:11:17.840
For the work done in this course,&nbsp;
you will create a triplet.&nbsp;

00:11:18.480 --> 00:11:22.000
The format will follow the third&nbsp;
example here highlighted in red.

00:11:26.720 --> 00:11:31.200
In using Simple Darwin Core, you may&nbsp;
discover that you have more data to share&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:34.240
but you cannot find corresponding terms in DwC.&nbsp;

00:11:35.280 --> 00:11:40.240
This data could be image or sound files or&nbsp;
perhaps you are responsible for a collection&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:40.240 --> 00:11:45.280
of vertebrates and you have extensive data&nbsp;
compiled on the weights and size of the specimens.&nbsp;

00:11:46.480 --> 00:11:50.800
Or even detailed historical information&nbsp;
on the identification of a taxon.&nbsp;

00:11:51.760 --> 00:11:54.960
When this occurs, you will&nbsp;
look to Darwin Core extensions&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:54.960 --> 00:12:00.400
so that you can extend the base data by providing&nbsp;
additional files that correspond to the base data.&nbsp;

00:12:01.680 --> 00:12:04.640
Extensions that would meet your&nbsp;
needs in these three examples are:

00:12:05.440 --> 00:12:07.520
Audubon Media Description (aka Audubon Core)

00:12:07.520 --> 00:12:08.560
Measurements or Facts

00:12:09.360 --> 00:12:10.800
Identification History

00:12:11.760 --> 00:12:13.840
There are many more extensions.&nbsp;

00:12:14.720 --> 00:12:23.840
GBIF maintains a list of all approved and&nbsp;
draft extensions on its tools subsite.

00:12:24.400 --> 00:12:27.680
There are many layers in our&nbsp;
biodiversity informatics community.&nbsp;

00:12:28.320 --> 00:12:32.960
The image here shows the relationships between&nbsp;
these layers and where they intersect with the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:32.960 --> 00:12:37.840
Darwin Core and where extensions maybe&nbsp;
necessary in order to fully share data.

00:12:40.240 --> 00:12:44.800
Data shared to GBIF is submitted&nbsp;
via a Darwin Core Archive or DwCA

00:12:45.520 --> 00:12:49.200
A DwCA is an expression of&nbsp;
the Darwin Core text guide.&nbsp;

00:12:49.760 --> 00:12:53.120
It is a compressed file containing&nbsp;
a minimum of three files.&nbsp;

00:12:53.680 --> 00:12:55.600
It is encoded as UTF-8.

00:12:56.480 --> 00:12:58.560
In this example, these three files are:

00:12:58.560 --> 00:13:05.680
1. A data file (occurrence.txt) conforming&nbsp;
to the SIMPLEDWC in a CSV format&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:05.680 --> 00:13:08.800
where the first row includes&nbsp;
Darwin Core standard term names.

00:13:10.080 --> 00:13:13.920
2. A meta file (meta.xml)&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:15.440 --> 00:13:20.240
in XML format containing technical details to&nbsp;
instruct a computer in how to use the data file.

00:13:20.240 --> 00:13:29.520
3. A meta file (eml.xml) in an XML format&nbsp;
containing explanatory details about the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:29.520 --> 00:13:34.560
records contained within the data file to instruct&nbsp;
a user if the data will be fit for their use.

00:13:35.760 --> 00:13:39.520
A more complex structure can be&nbsp;
obtained by sharing multiple related&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:39.520 --> 00:13:44.000
csv files to extend the data.
They are related to the core&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:48.320
file by way of a unique id.
In an occurrence dataset,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:48.320 --> 00:13:51.760
these related csv files are&nbsp;
related by the occurrenceID.

00:13:56.240 --> 00:13:59.280
We’ve covered What Darwin Core&nbsp;
Is and hopefully you’ve started&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:59.280 --> 00:14:01.840
to develop a sense of why you should use it.

00:14:02.400 --> 00:14:08.160
It is a standard and standards are good!&nbsp;
Standards provide us with the rules and protocols&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:08.160 --> 00:14:10.080
we need to share our data with others.

00:14:11.200 --> 00:14:13.920
Darwin Core also provides&nbsp;
us with a common language.&nbsp;

00:14:14.480 --> 00:14:17.360
As we saw in the Foundations&nbsp;
– Documentation presentation,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:18.080 --> 00:14:21.280
source data can be tricky when&nbsp;
trying to compare datasets.&nbsp;

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:24.400
The fields in your source data&nbsp;
might be different than the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:24.400 --> 00:14:30.000
fields in another institutions data source.
When we all use Darwin Core to share our data,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:33.040
we understand that data has been&nbsp;
shared with a common language.

00:14:35.120 --> 00:14:40.720
And it’s not only the data holders that understand&nbsp;
this common language, the data users do as well.&nbsp;

00:14:41.360 --> 00:14:46.560
And after all, what could be better than a user&nbsp;
finding a data set that is fit for their use,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:47.120 --> 00:14:50.800
shared in a common language, that&nbsp;
allows them to do better science.

00:14:54.640 --> 00:14:55.120
Thank you.

This video is part of a series&nbsp;
of presentations used in the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:04.560 --> 00:15:07.200
GBIF Biodiversity Data Mobilization course.&nbsp;

00:15:08.160 --> 00:15:12.320
The biodiversity data mobilization curriculum&nbsp;
was originally developed as part of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:12.320 --> 00:15:16.720
Biodiversity Information Development&nbsp;
Programme funded by the European Union.

00:15:18.160 --> 00:15:22.800
This presentation was originally created&nbsp;
by Paula Zermoglio and John Wieczorek&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:22.800 --> 00:15:26.720
with additional contributions by&nbsp;
Sharon Grant, Sophie Pamerlon,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:26.720 --> 00:15:32.320
