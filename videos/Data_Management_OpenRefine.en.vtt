00:00:01.120 --> 00:00:05.840
In this presentation, we are going to introduce&nbsp;
OpenRefine as a tool for data cleaning.

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:15.440
Previously known as Google Refine; it is now Open&nbsp;
access and open sourced. OpenRefine can be used&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:20.080
for data cleaning and standardization.&nbsp;
You can find it at openrefine.org.

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:25.760
OpenRefine is a powerful tool&nbsp;
for working with messy data.

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:32.080
OpenRefine supports faceted browsing as a&nbsp;
mechanism for seeing a big picture of your data,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:36.720
and filtering down to just the subset&nbsp;
of rows that you want to change in bulk.

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:42.320
The clustering feature works by trying&nbsp;
to group the choices in the text facet,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:45.760
so that choices that "look&nbsp;
similar" get grouped together.

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:52.800
Reconciliation is a semi-automated process of&nbsp;
matching text names to database IDs (keys).&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:58.160
You can use OpenRefine to perform&nbsp;
reconciliation of names in your data&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:01.120
against any database that exposes a web service.

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:10.480
OpenRefine, however, is not like other tools&nbsp;
youâ€™ve used. OpenRefine CANNOT be used for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:15.280
storing or managing data; it is strictly&nbsp;
a cleaning and/or standardizing tool.

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:22.400
As OpenRefine is a different kind&nbsp;
of tool, you should consider when&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:26.160
it is appropriate to use it versus other tools.

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:30.240
A database provides infrastructure&nbsp;
for storage and indexing of data.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:36.000
Generally, it requires programming skills&nbsp;
to edit and is absent of easy visualization.

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:42.640
Excel is a spreadsheet application. It is useful&nbsp;
for documenting data and performing operations.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:46.720
And while you can manage your data&nbsp;
and have limited ability to clean and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:51.040
standardize your data, it is usually&nbsp;
restricted to editing cell by cell.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:56.000
Data is not always visible and it&nbsp;
lacks powerful visualization tools.

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.880
OpenRefine in contrast offers multi-cell editing,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:05.040
easy exploration and transformation&nbsp;
and interactive visualization.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:09.680
But as mentioned previously, it is&nbsp;
not for storing and managing data.

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:15.680
So now that you understand the differences,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:19.200
here is a list of useful features&nbsp;
that you will find within OpenRefine.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:23.840
You will soon have an opportunity to&nbsp;
complete a tutorial to try all the features.

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:28.000
OpenRefine is a software that&nbsp;
you install on your computer.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:34.320
It requires the JAVA JRE/JDK to run.&nbsp;
It works on Windows, Mac and Linux.

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:39.360
As OpenRefine is free and open source,&nbsp;
it is supported by a large community&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:44.720
of developers and users. It easy to find&nbsp;
tutorials online on how to use the tool.

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:50.960

This video is part of a series of presentations&nbsp;
used in the GBIF Biodiversity Data Mobilization&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:05.600
course. The biodiversity data mobilization&nbsp;
curriculum was originally developed as part&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:10.320
of the Biodiversity Information Development&nbsp;
Programme funded by the European Union. 
 &nbsp;

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:16.080
This presentation was originally created by&nbsp;
Nestor Beltran with additional contributions&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:21.040
by Sharon Grant, David Bloom, BID and&nbsp;
BIFA Trainers, Mentors and Students.

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:26.560
This presentation has been&nbsp;
narrated by Laura Anne Russell.
