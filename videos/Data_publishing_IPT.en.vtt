00:00:01.459 --> 00:00:08.090
This presentation introduces the Integrated
Publishing Toolkit and its interface.

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:14.390
The Integrated Publishing Toolkit -- the IPT--
is software that is installed on a server.

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:17.930
It requires a Java applet like Tomcat to run.

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:24.269
Just like Excel helps you create spreadsheets,
the IPT helps you create darwin core archives

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:29.939
files, register them with GBIF and makes them
discoverable on the internet.

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:35.070
Many institutions do not have the technical
resources to host their own IPT, if that is

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:40.600
the case with your institution, please investigate
the data hosting options on the GBIF website

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:45.320
under the How-to menu.

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:51.429
After installing an IPT, an administrator
is required to manage user accounts, publishing

00:00:51.429 --> 00:00:55.969
organizations and Darwin Core extensions.
If your data is being hosted within your own

00:00:55.969 --> 00:01:01.660
institution or by another institution, make
sure you know who the administrator is so

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:06.840
that they can assist you when necessary.

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:11.630
The IPT can be installed in either a test
environment or in a production environment.

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:16.770
For the purposes of this course, we will be
using a test and training environment.

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.560
When you browse to an IPT page, you will not
be logged in.

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:23.230
And you will only have two tabs available
to you.

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:28.509
A home tab and an About tab.

00:01:28.509 --> 00:01:33.510
After logging into the IPT, you will have
more tabs available to you.

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:39.420
Managers with (and without) registration rights
will see the Manage Resources tab.

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:46.430
Administrators will see the Manager Resources
tab and an Administration tab.

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:51.939
At the bottom of the Manage Resources tab
is a section to Create a New Resource.

00:01:51.939 --> 00:01:57.290
A shortname is an abbreviated, but descriptive
name that will become part of your URL.

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:08.310
It cannot have spaces. An example would be
fmnh-herps, or wcs_camera_traps

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:13.050
When creating a resource, do not attempt to
add an archive file at this point.

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:17.610
You will do it after the resource is created.
You will see a video demonstration of this

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:22.970
process in the next section.

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:26.900
After creating a resource, you will be directed
to the resource page.

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:30.950
Here you will have multiple options for editing
the resource.

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:34.950
The first section is for Source Data.
This is where you will upload your source

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:39.410
data files or make database connections to
your source data.

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:42.390
For this course, we will upload files.

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:47.950
Once a file is uploaded, you have the opportunity
to edit some information about the file.

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:54.040
You can upload delimited text files which
include csv, tab, and files using any other

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:58.790
delimiter, either directly or compressed with
zip or gzip.&nbsp;

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:03.650
Excel files are also supported.&nbsp;
After a file is uploaded, you will then have

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:07.590
an Edit button.
You can upload mutliple files if you find

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:11.550
you will be using extended data with main
file.

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:17.420
Alternatively, you can configure&nbsp;SQL views&nbsp;to
databases in your local network.

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:24.310
To create a new SQL source, please click "Connect
to database" without any file chosen.

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:28.250
Creating a database connection will require
you to coordinate with your IT support to

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:33.110
ensure appropriate permissions.
Database connections are typically only supported

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:39.180
by institutions hosting their own IPT.

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:42.620
After a dataset is added, the next step is
to map the data.

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:48.040
You will see this demonstrated in a later
video.

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:52.360
The third section of the resource is where
you will add your metadata describing your

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:55.620
dataset.

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:59.150
Most of the data on the Basic metadata page
is required.

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:04.740
You must choose a dataset license or waiver
and a publishing organization if you intended

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:09.320
to register your dataset with GBIF.
If you have a GBIF-funded project, you will

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:16.209
also need to add your project identifier on
the Project data page.

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:23.229
After the first three sections are complete,
a resource can be published.

00:04:23.229 --> 00:04:27.129
A resource must be public in order to register
it with GBIF.

00:04:27.129 --> 00:04:31.949
If the resource is made public after the initial
publication, it will need to be published

00:04:31.949 --> 00:04:35.409
a second time before it can be registered
with GBIF.

00:04:35.409 --> 00:04:44.250
The last section allows you to add other users
to help manager your resource.

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:48.949
As a reminder, to register a dataset resource
with GBIF, a publishing organization must

00:04:48.949 --> 00:04:53.699
be set in the Metadata section and the resource
must be set to Public.

00:04:53.699 --> 00:04:57.969
Once these conditions are met, then the Register
button will be available.

00:04:57.969 --> 00:05:05.120
If the button is not immediately available.
Try publishing one more time.

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:10.210
Once a dataset is registered with GBIF, it
will show up under the publishing institutionâ€™s

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:14.560
datasets in the GBIF portal.

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:18.419
Once the dataset is registered with GBIF,
it is given a DOI.

00:05:18.419 --> 00:05:23.849
This DOI will allow users of the data to give
proper credit to the dataset and the publishing

00:05:23.849 --> 00:05:29.810
institution if the dataset is used in research.
GBIF tracks citations.

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:35.930
Any time the dataset DOI is used in a paper,
the citation number on the dataset will increase.

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:41.419
You can click the Citation button to see which
papers used your dataset.

00:05:41.419 --> 00:05:46.860
Also from this page, you can access the occurrences
records associated with the dataset.

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:52.749
If a checklist, youâ€™d be able to see the
taxons.

00:05:52.749 --> 00:06:01.039
All the metadata you entered in IPT is nicely
displayed on the dataset page.

00:06:01.039 --> 00:06:04.150
There are many community resources available
to you.

00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:09.219
In the next section you will watch a demonstration
video of publishing an occurrence dataset

00:06:09.219 --> 00:06:12.960
with an extension on the ipt.

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:13.960
Thank you.

00:06:19.629 --> 00:06:24.949
This video is part of a series of presentations
used in the GBIF Biodiversity Data Mobilization

00:06:24.949 --> 00:06:28.580
course.
The biodiversity data mobilization curriculum

00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:33.479
was originally developed as part of the Biodiversity
Information Development Programme funded by

00:06:33.479 --> 00:06:35.680
the European Union.
&nbsp;

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:40.050
This presentation was originally created by
Nicolas Noe with additional contributions

00:06:40.050 --> 00:06:47.060
by Sophie Pamerlon, Marie Elise Lecoq, Laura
Anne Russell, Dag Endresen, Rukaya Johaadien,

00:06:47.060 --> 00:06:50.370
BID and BIFA Trainers, Mentors and students.
&nbsp;

00:06:50.370 --> 00:06:53.369
This presentation has been narrated by Laura
Anne Russell.
