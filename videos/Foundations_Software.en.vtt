00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:07.309
This session is foundation work and part of
the Terminology section.

00:00:07.309 --> 00:00:19.370
We will be introducing you to types of software
used in data mobilization.

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:23.740
The purpose of this short presentation is
to give you some examples of the different

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:28.730
types of applications and software available
in the world of biodiversity mobilization

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:30.520
informatics.

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:35.520
Hopefully it will help you to start to think
about what uses they may be put too and what

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.710
types of things might be practical for you.

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:43.990
So very briefly, a definition.

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:49.620
We are making a distinction here between all
software and those applications which have

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:54.870
been created for an end-user to carry out
a task.

00:00:54.870 --> 00:01:01.410
We will take a look at software that can be
used for: Data Capture, Data Management, Data

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:08.330
Cleaning and Data Publishing.

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:13.789
In the realm of data capture software, there
is often no need to go "big" when capturing

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:17.670
information initially, especially in the field.

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:22.509
You can capture information from collection
specimens or live observations in a simple

00:01:22.509 --> 00:01:28.950
spreadsheet such as Excel, OpenOffice, LibreOffice
or Google Sheets.

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:35.749
There may even not be a need to create your
own system at all.

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:44.460
Apps such as iNaturalist, or eBird are stable,
robust and have simple intuitive interfaces.

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:48.849
Whichever the choice, it is important to think
about the long term preservation of the data

00:01:48.849 --> 00:01:52.570
that you collect.

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:59.259
So, depending on your needs, a more complex
data management software might be the right

00:01:59.259 --> 00:02:01.340
solution for your data.

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:06.649
Especially if long term retention and preservation
is a priority.

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:14.510
More stable management platforms also better
support sharing of data to multiple audiences.

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:20.250
There are many choices which vary in terms
of cost and support and a few are shown here.

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:25.269
From left to right: Symbiota, Specify, EMu,
Elysia and Brahms.

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:38.439
If a 
home-grown solution is preferred and can be

00:02:38.439 --> 00:02:45.829
supported, relational database software can
provide cheaper alternatives.

00:02:45.829 --> 00:02:58.690
Examples incluse MySQL, SQLServer, Access
or filemaker.

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:03.000
Increasingly the lines between languages,
programs and tools have blurred, each being

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.950
capable of many complex and overlapping functions.

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:11.470
The common Find and Replace function is a
good example of a data cleaning tool that

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:16.629
is found in almost all database programs and
is a command in database languages.

00:03:16.629 --> 00:03:22.120
You are probably already familiar with spreadsheets
such as Excel and indeed these are probably

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:26.060
the most common data cleaning tools available.

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:28.550
However there are others.

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:34.010
OpenRefine originally known as GoogleRefine
is a powerful free, open source data cleaning

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:36.819
tool with a large support community.

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:40.769
You will see more of this program in upcoming
sessions.

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:47.200
R is another increasingly used, sophisticated
programming language and environment.

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:56.319
With a little practice it can also provide
powerful data manipulations.

00:03:56.319 --> 00:04:01.109
Planning further ahead to the sharing of your
data through GBIF to the international scientific

00:04:01.109 --> 00:04:06.189
and deciders community you will need to choose
a publishing tool.

00:04:06.189 --> 00:04:11.750
The choice will depend largely on the level
of infrastructure support at your institution.

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:18.600
If this is high and stable, installing an
IPT or BioCASe application may be the right

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:19.600
option.

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:21.910
But there are others if this is not the case.

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:27.060
You can consider partnering with an existing
ipt provider or selecting a database management

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:30.430
system that includes a publishing pathway
of its own.

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:36.670
Whichever you choose, make sure that your
system allows you to export data as csv or

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:44.320
txt files and you will ultimately be able
to publish your data.

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:49.690
This is a summary of the information collected
in the course survey of software in use by

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:53.910
students, mentors and trainers in the GBIF
community.

00:04:53.910 --> 00:05:03.820
The link and reference to more details of
each section, is at the bottom of the slide.

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:08.740
Remember that: The purpose of software is
to help people and not the other way around.

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:15.620
Your choice of solution should make your life
easier but it should also not sacrifice the

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:20.810
long term viability of the data that it is
meant to work with.

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:28.910

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:35.790
This video is part of a series of presentations
used in the GBIF Biodiversity Data Mobilization

00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:36.950
course.

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:42.122
The biodiversity data mobilization curriculum
was originally developed as part of the Biodiversity

00:05:42.122 --> 00:05:46.770
Information Development Programme funded by
the European Union.

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:48.780
This presentation was originally created by
Sophie Pamerlon and is narrated by Sharon

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:53.650
Grant with additional contributions by BID
and BIFA Trainers, Mentors and Students.
