00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:05.860
In this presentation, we will introduce you
to the concept of Data Publishing.

00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:12.940
We will also introduce you to GBIF’s Integrated
Publishing Toolkit.

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:18.740
At this point in the course, you have moved
through all the sections of mobilization project.

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:20.810
Now you are ready to share your data.

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:25.500
You’ve produced a cleaned and standardized
dataset and you want to share and see that

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:30.320
data on the GBIF data portal.

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:35.360
But there is more to it than simply handing
over a spreadsheet or a text file to GBIF.

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:38.310
You must publish the data.

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:44.390
Data publishing is the act of making biodiversity
datasets publicly accessible and discoverable,

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:49.080
in a standardized form (ie Darwin Core), via
an access point.

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:54.350
This access point is a URL – a web address.

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:59.580
Most organizations within the GBIF Network,
otherwise known as publishers, make use of

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:03.350
an IPT, the Integrated Publishing Toolkit,
to publish their data.

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:07.871
These publishers may choose to host their
own installation of an IPT like the Field

00:01:07.871 --> 00:01:13.280
Museum, but generally prefer to find a suitable
host for their data publishing activities.

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:18.920
This might be through an established GBIF
Participant Node like GBIF France or through

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:20.970
an established thematic group like VertNet.

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:27.700
Or, a another option, might be to make use
of one of the GBIF-hosted IPTs like the BID,

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:30.860
BIFA or regional IPTs.

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:35.530
If you are part of groups like Symbiota or
the Living Atlases Communities, they have

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:42.050
other means to assist you with publishing
your data to GBIF.

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:46.049
The definition on the previous Slide should
probably be updated to include some words

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:48.590
about waivers and licenses.

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:55.090
The act of not only making the data accessible,
but making it as open as possible.

00:01:55.090 --> 00:02:00.580
In an effort to document the level of openness
of a dataset, GBIF maintains, in keeping with

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:06.850
a 2014 decision by the GBIF governing board,
that all data published and registered for

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:13.040
use in the GBIF portal, must be issued with
one of three Creative Commons options:

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:20.879
CC0, a waiver for data made available for
any use without any restrictions

00:02:20.879 --> 00:02:27.569
CC BY, a license for data made available for
any use with appropriate attribution

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:33.760
CC BY-NC, a license for data made available
for any non-commercial use with appropriate

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:36.590
attribution.

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:42.939
Note that CC-BY-NC licences have a significant
effect on the reusability of data.

00:02:42.939 --> 00:02:51.150
GBIF encourages data publishers to choose
the most open option they can wherever possible.

00:02:51.150 --> 00:03:01.319
Projects supported through GBIF-led funding
must use either the CC0 or CC BY options.

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:06.870
The Integrated Publishing Toolkit (IPT) is
a free, open source software tool written

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:13.439
in Java that is used to publish and share
biodiversity datasets through the GBIF network.

00:03:13.439 --> 00:03:17.439
The first version of IPT was released in 2009.

00:03:17.439 --> 00:03:21.579
It was redesigned and rereleased in 2011.

00:03:21.579 --> 00:03:25.989
Since that time, the IPT has been updated
periodically with new features, bug fixes

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:27.760
and security improvements.

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:34.489
While the IPT is maintained at GBIF, the community
of biodiversity informatics developers are

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:37.879
able to contribute to its development.

00:03:37.879 --> 00:03:41.099
Some of the features include:

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:45.099
Main (but not only) publishing tool for GBIF.

00:03:45.099 --> 00:03:52.949
One IPT can host many datasets, on behalf
of several institutions, each clearly represented

00:03:52.949 --> 00:03:56.079
Test mode and production mode

00:03:56.079 --> 00:04:00.689
Multilingual – it has been translated into
7 languages.

00:04:00.689 --> 00:04:05.279
It is a server-side software, so it needs
a stable connection and requires technical

00:04:05.279 --> 00:04:07.290
administration.

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:12.870
This is why many institutions choose to publish
their data on hosted IPTs.

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:18.500
You can find more information on data hosting
on the GBIF website under the How-to menu.

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:23.830
For the remainder of our course, we’ll be
demonstrating and completing exercises using

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:26.639
the IPT.

00:04:26.639 --> 00:04:32.669
We’re now putting together what you learned
in the first two presentations in the Data

00:04:32.669 --> 00:04:36.340
Capture section on Standards and Darwin Core
and Data Types.

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:42.000
At its heart, the IPT is based on Darwin Core
and the Darwin Core text guide and its recommendations

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.680
for sharing data in a Darwin Core Archive.

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:50.940
The Darwin Core contains three distinct data
cores which match up to three of the dataset

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:54.140
types that GBIF accepts.

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:55.629
Keep in mind:

00:04:55.629 --> 00:04:59.699
Each dataset has one and only one Core file

00:04:59.699 --> 00:05:07.160
Each Core file corresponds to a dataset type:
occurrence, checklist or sampling event.

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:11.770
Each dataset can have one or more extensions
file

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:17.810
The aim of an extension is to add new data
fields not present in the core.

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:24.810
Each entry in the core file is linked to zero,
one or several rows in an extension file.

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:32.199
Each row in an extension file reference one
and only one row in the core file.

00:05:32.199 --> 00:05:33.970
Some examples:

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:37.610
Core is Occurrence, no extensions

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:41.389
Core is Occurrence, with “multimedia”
extension

00:05:41.389 --> 00:05:47.050
Core is Occurrence, with Audubon core and
measurementorfact extensions

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:50.129
Core is Taxon, no extensions

00:05:50.129 --> 00:05:54.319
Core is Taxon, with species distribution extension

00:05:54.319 --> 00:06:02.900
Core is Event with Occurrence and Measurementorfact
extensions

00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:05.159
The first core is the Occurrence Core.

00:06:05.159 --> 00:06:11.970
As a reminder, an occurrence dataset contains
one individual or one group of individuals.

00:06:11.970 --> 00:06:16.240
Each row has a unique identifier, an occurrenceID.

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:21.819
Other fields for occurrence data include where,
when, how and by whom was each occurrence

00:06:21.819 --> 00:06:27.530
observed and/or collected in the field.

00:06:27.530 --> 00:06:30.470
The next option is the Taxon core.

00:06:30.470 --> 00:06:35.620
As a reminder, a checklist dataset contains
taxonomic concepts, not individuals.

00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:40.319
It is a “A catalogue or list of named organisms,
or taxa.”

00:06:40.319 --> 00:06:42.949
Each row will have a taxonID.

00:06:42.949 --> 00:06:49.060
Each taxon must be unique.

00:06:49.060 --> 00:06:51.219
The last option is the Event core.

00:06:51.219 --> 00:06:57.650
As a reminder, sampling event datasets allow
data publishers to provide greater detail,

00:06:57.650 --> 00:07:02.510
not only offering evidence that a species
occurred at a given location and date, but

00:07:02.510 --> 00:07:08.169
also making it possible to assess community
composition for broader taxonomic groups or

00:07:08.169 --> 00:07:12.129
even the abundance of species at multiple
times and places.

00:07:12.129 --> 00:07:18.480
By indicating the methods, events and relative
abundance of species recorded in a sample,

00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:23.370
these datasets improve comparisons with data
collected using the same protocols at different

00:07:23.370 --> 00:07:29.750
times and places—in some cases, even leading
researchers to infer the absence of particular

00:07:29.750 --> 00:07:33.699
species from particular sites.

00:07:33.699 --> 00:07:36.199
Each row will have an EventID.

00:07:36.199 --> 00:07:42.740
Each event must be unique.

00:07:42.740 --> 00:07:47.599
This is a good point to review all of the
fields required by GBIF.

00:07:47.599 --> 00:07:54.169
If required fields are not supplied, GBIF
will have difficult indexing your dataset.

00:07:54.169 --> 00:07:59.129
Each core has its own set of required and
recommended fields for the dataset and for

00:07:59.129 --> 00:08:02.740
the associated dataset metadata.

00:08:02.740 --> 00:08:08.099
As you now know, metadata is the data about
your data and it enables users to know if

00:08:08.099 --> 00:08:11.060
your dataset will be fit for their use.

00:08:11.060 --> 00:08:14.960
Don’t stop at the required and recommended
fields.

00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:20.770
The more data you are able to share, the more
useful your dataset can be to end users.

00:08:20.770 --> 00:08:29.499
You can find the data quality on the gbif
website under the How-to menu.

00:08:29.499 --> 00:08:33.400
Extensions were introduced in the Standards
presentation.

00:08:33.400 --> 00:08:37.450
Publishing a dataset is now where you will
put them into use.

00:08:37.450 --> 00:08:42.440
As mentioned previously, GBIF maintains the
list of approved and draft extensions on its

00:08:42.440 --> 00:08:43.810
tools subsite.

00:08:43.810 --> 00:08:50.730
The approved extensions can be enabled by
an IPT administrator on a Production IPT.

00:08:50.730 --> 00:08:56.090
Draft extensions can be enabled by an IPT
administrator on a Test IPT.

00:08:56.090 --> 00:09:00.710
If you know you have data that cannot be shared
with Simple Darwin Core, it is worth reviewing

00:09:00.710 --> 00:09:03.900
the list of available extensions.

00:09:03.900 --> 00:09:09.230
If you think an extension doesn’t exist,
try reaching out to members of the TDWG community

00:09:09.230 --> 00:09:11.960
or posting on the Darwin Core issues site.

00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:16.520
Community members will help guide you.

00:09:16.520 --> 00:09:23.500
Also, in the standards presentation, you were
introduced to Darwin Core Archives.

00:09:23.500 --> 00:09:26.770
This is an example of a Darwin Core archive
with extensions.

00:09:26.770 --> 00:09:32.680
It’s an occurrence dataset that has been
published with images, determination history

00:09:32.680 --> 00:09:38.140
and genebank information.

00:09:38.140 --> 00:09:42.750
Until now, it may have been difficult to imagine
how two single files can be related.

00:09:42.750 --> 00:09:47.890
A core with an extension can represent the
following relationships.

00:09:47.890 --> 00:09:48.940
one to zero

00:09:48.940 --> 00:09:49.950
one to one

00:09:49.950 --> 00:09:52.450
one to many

00:09:52.450 --> 00:09:55.850
The core file will always contain unique records.

00:09:55.850 --> 00:10:03.390
In this example using the Taxon Core, each
taxon is unique and is represented by a taxonID.

00:10:03.390 --> 00:10:08.750
In Vernacular Names extension file, each vernacular
name is unique.

00:10:08.750 --> 00:10:17.830
The first three represent common names for
the species Struthio camelus (one to many

00:10:17.830 --> 00:10:19.330
relationship).

00:10:19.330 --> 00:10:26.250
The fourth name represents the common name
for the species Alectoris chukar (one to one

00:10:26.250 --> 00:10:28.370
relationship).

00:10:28.370 --> 00:10:33.500
In this example the third and fourth taxons
in the core file, do not have a match in the

00:10:33.500 --> 00:10:34.810
extension file.

00:10:34.810 --> 00:10:41.020
(one to zero relationship).

00:10:41.020 --> 00:10:46.140
As we finish up this presentation, we’d
like for you to begin exploring the IPT.

00:10:46.140 --> 00:10:49.900
In the e-Learning platform, you will find
your login information and the location of

00:10:49.900 --> 00:10:50.940
the test IPT.

00:10:50.940 --> 00:10:54.150
Login and a take a look around.

00:10:54.150 --> 00:10:59.010
In the next presentation, you will watch a
demonstration on how to use the IPT, after

00:10:59.010 --> 00:11:02.240
which you’ll be ready to try it yourself.

00:11:02.240 --> 00:11:05.520
Thank you.

00:11:05.520 --> 00:11:10.100
If you have questions on this presentation,
please use the provided forum in the e-Learning

00:11:10.100 --> 00:11:11.900
platform.

00:11:11.900 --> 00:11:16.970
This video is part of a series of presentations
used in the GBIF Biodiversity Data Mobilization

00:11:16.970 --> 00:11:18.040
course.

00:11:18.040 --> 00:11:22.990
The biodiversity data mobilization curriculum
was originally developed as part of the Biodiversity

00:11:22.990 --> 00:11:28.140
Information Development Programme funded by
the European Union.

00:11:28.140 --> 00:11:32.850
This presentation was originally created by
Sophie Pamerlon with additional contributions

00:11:32.850 --> 00:11:39.360
by Nicolas Noe, Laura Anne Russell and Dag
Endresen, BID and BIFA Trainers, Mentors and

00:11:39.360 --> 00:11:40.830
students.

00:11:40.830 --> 00:11:43.740
This presentation has been narrated by Laura
Anne Russell.
