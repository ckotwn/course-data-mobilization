00:00:00.879 --> 00:00:04.410
In this presentation, we’ll have a look
at the different types of data that can be

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:08.840
called ‘primary biodiversity data’ and
shared within GBIF.

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:13.780
These data can be complex and have different
origins; we’ll see how they can be structured

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:18.429
into one of the three data classes accepted
by GBIF, based on the Darwin Core data sharing

00:00:18.429 --> 00:00:25.050
standard that is used within the GBIF community.

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:31.400
As you can see on this slide, GBIF currently
supports four types of dataset: Resource datasets

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:41.110
(e.g. metadata-only datasets), species checklists,
Occurrence datasets and Sampling-event datasets.

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:46.840
I will not discuss Resource datasets in this
presentation as metadata-only datasets are

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:53.040
not supported by the GBIF-funded programmes.

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:58.680
The first type of dataset that can be published
within GBIF is the checklist, aka a list of

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.120
species or higher taxa.

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:06.870
In a checklist, the main unit is the taxon,
not the occurrence (individual).

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:13.609
Checklists, and more generally, taxonomical
datasets can vary in scope :

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:17.249
a list of species present in a protected area
is a checklist.

00:01:17.249 --> 00:01:23.819
a national or thematic list of taxa (e.g.
Butterflies of Laos, or the Flora of Malaysia),

00:01:23.819 --> 00:01:29.280
which sometimes provide more info on the distribution,
taxonomical hierarchy and synonyms of the

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.210
taxa is a checklist.

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:38.380
IUCN red lists (at the international, national
or regional levels) also are checklists and

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:45.299
can give more information about the vulnerability
status of the listed taxa. 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:50.939
GBIF provides data publishers with templates
for each class of dataset.

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:56.209
The GBIF template for checklists (taxon Data)
allows you to share information linked to

00:01:56.209 --> 00:02:03.420
each species or taxa: its ID, full name and
authorship, relationship to other taxa, geographical

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.490
details and so on.

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:10.640
In this template, one line represents one
taxon and a taxon can only appear once in

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:17.000
the dataset (otherwise it will create a duplicate).

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.570
The second type of data that can be published
within GBIF is data coming from natural history

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:25.020
or scientific collections, also known as specimens.

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:31.310
Unlike checklists, the main unit in a specimen
collection will be the specimen (a single

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:37.250
organism or group of organisms), and you can
have multiple specimens from the same species

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:41.790
or taxon group.

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:46.720
Collections and specimens vastly differ in
numbers, size and preservation methods.

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:51.800
However, any kind of collection that holds
preserved living organisms can be captured

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:57.240
and shared within GBIF; herbarium or zoological
collections (including fossils) for example,

00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:04.010
but geology or human artifacts collections
do not fall under the GBIF scope.

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:10.280
Biodiversity data can also be found in technical
and scientific literature: it is possible

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:15.920
to compile and share this kind of data within
GBIF, but you should be extra-cautious not

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:21.430
to share duplicate data (for example, a specimen
described in a scientific article might already

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:27.980
be present on GBIF.org in the dataset of its
collection)

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:33.790
In the absence of digitized datasets, biodiversity
data can be extracted and compiled from scientific

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:40.630
articles, phD or master theses, reports and
other documents.

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:45.980
ALWAYS contact the data owner first when compiling
literature data to ask for permission to publish

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:50.060
them to GBIF ! 

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:55.910
A large majority of the data available on
GBIF.org now comes from fieldwork records.

00:03:55.910 --> 00:04:01.460
These data can be observed and/or collected
using different protocols in the field, by

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:09.520
scientists, naturalists or amateur citizen-scientists
via programmes and apps.

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:14.840
These field data can be compiled in survey
reports, environmental impact assessment studies,

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:17.160
field notes and other logs.

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:21.670
They can be linked to other types of data,
such as checklists, which are complementary

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:28.820
to occurrence data observed or collected in
the wilderness.

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:33.320
Occurrence data represents the GBIF class
of datasets with the largest number of records

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:35.150
on GBIF.org.

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:40.790
Collection (aka specimens), literature and
fieldwork data can be shared within GBIF using

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:46.670
this template, which focuses on the observed
individual or collected specimen.

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:51.510
In this kind of dataset, multiple individuals
or specimens can be recorded for a single

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:56.400
taxon, as long as they each have a unique
identifier.

00:04:56.400 --> 00:05:02.139
Other fields for occurrence data include where,
when, how and by whom was each occurrence

00:05:02.139 --> 00:05:06.720
observed and/or collected in the field.

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:13.409
Event data is a class of datasets that was
added on GBIF.org in 2015.

00:05:13.409 --> 00:05:18.650
They allow data publishers to share more information
about the context of the observation or collection

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:25.180
of specimens, and to group occurrences linked
to the same event.

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:30.240
The GBIF template for Event data allows data
publishers to share more information about

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:36.830
the context of a biodiversity data collecting/recording
event such as camera traps, insect traps,

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:40.230
botanical relevés, birding sites and so on.

00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:45.480
Its structure is a bit more complex than the
Taxonomical datasets and Occurrence datasets

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:52.470
as it involves two files (e.g., two tabs in
a spreadsheet): one for describing the ‘events’

00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:58.790
(e.g. each trap) and the other one to describe
the specimens or occurrences linked to each

00:05:58.790 --> 00:06:00.760
event.

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:06.949
Sometimes, additional information or data
can be found using other source materials

00:06:06.949 --> 00:06:12.660
than those previously mentioned in this video.

00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:17.960
These other sources include remote sensing
tools, maps and satellite data, and other

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:22.790
information supports such as pictures, audio
and video recordings of wildlife.

00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:28.150
Most of the time, the information retrieved
this way is supplemental to existing data

00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:33.910
but can provide valuable information about
individuals and their location, habitat, migratory

00:06:33.910 --> 00:06:37.520
routes, etc.

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:41.680
In the following slides, we will see how the
Darwin Core standard works with different

00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:49.460
types of data, and how to choose the dataset
class that best fits a given dataset.

00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:54.030
As you learned in the Foundations - Darwin
Core presentation, Darwin Core is a data sharing

00:06:54.030 --> 00:07:00.919
standard developed by the Biodiversity Information
Standards (TDWG) organization, and is widely

00:07:00.919 --> 00:07:05.550
used to publish data within the extended GBIF
community.

00:07:05.550 --> 00:07:09.440
Depending on the type of dataset with which
you work, you’ll have to choose one of its

00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:16.020
three Cores (Occurrence, Taxon or Event Core),
which can be linked to one or more Extensions

00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:21.900
to share more information (such as multimedia
links, variables, identification history and

00:07:21.900 --> 00:07:22.900
so on).

00:07:22.900 --> 00:07:29.320
In some cases, a core can be used as an extension
linked to another core: that is the case when

00:07:29.320 --> 00:07:34.680
publishing Event data, where one can use the
Event Core to describe the sampled areas and

00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:42.620
then use the Occurrence Core as an Extension
to share the specimens or individuals recorded.

00:07:42.620 --> 00:07:47.370
Once the data has been standardized using
the Darwin Core standard, each class of dataset

00:07:47.370 --> 00:07:53.650
(metadata-only, sampling event, taxonomic
or occurrence datasets) can be published on

00:07:53.650 --> 00:07:58.120
GBIF.org using one of the tools mentioned
on this figure.

00:07:58.120 --> 00:08:03.169
The most frequently used tool within the GBIF
community is the GBIF-developed Integrated

00:08:03.169 --> 00:08:09.350
Publishing Toolkit (IPT), which transforms
the source data into Darwin Core archives

00:08:09.350 --> 00:08:13.070
that are then harvested and indexed by GBIF.

00:08:13.070 --> 00:08:19.500
The data are then searchable and downloadable
via GBIF.org.

00:08:19.500 --> 00:08:23.540
Choosing a dataset class can take some time,
especially if you’re new to data publishing

00:08:23.540 --> 00:08:24.890
within GBIF.

00:08:24.890 --> 00:08:30.430
The GBIF helpdesk team created this useful
flowchart which can be found on the GBIF Data

00:08:30.430 --> 00:08:31.650
Blog:

00:08:31.650 --> 00:08:36.479
If your data are not yet captured in a database
or spreadsheet, or if they are too incomplete

00:08:36.479 --> 00:08:42.599
to be shared yet, you can publish a description
of your data as a metadata-only dataset (please

00:08:42.599 --> 00:08:47.830
note this option is not allowed in the context
of the BID and BIFA programmes).

00:08:47.830 --> 00:08:53.320
If your dataset contains a list of scientific
names that are not referring to observed and/or

00:08:53.320 --> 00:08:59.380
collected organisms or specimens, you can
publish it as a taxonomical resource, or checklist.

00:08:59.380 --> 00:09:04.770
If your dataset includes scientific names
linked to observed and/or collected specimens,

00:09:04.770 --> 00:09:09.300
as well as dates and locations, you can share
it as an occurrence dataset.

00:09:09.300 --> 00:09:14.480
Lastly, if information about the protocols
used on the field are available, you can choose

00:09:14.480 --> 00:09:19.830
to share your dataset as a sampling-event
dataset.

00:09:19.830 --> 00:09:25.440
Each class of dataset shared within GBIF has
to meet its own data quality requirements.

00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:30.870
Some requirements are mandatory (such as the
occurrenceID, taxonID or eventID, depending

00:09:30.870 --> 00:09:36.550
on the type of dataset), others are optional
but strongly recommended (such as coordinates

00:09:36.550 --> 00:09:38.170
in decimal degrees).

00:09:38.170 --> 00:09:44.510
You can find these requirements on GBIF.org
from the How-to menu.

00:09:44.510 --> 00:09:49.130
In order to be able to publish data to GBIF,
it is important to understand the differences

00:09:49.130 --> 00:09:55.190
between the dataset classes at the early stages
of the data capture and data managing process.

00:09:55.190 --> 00:09:58.320
You can reflect on this topic with the following
questions:

00:09:58.320 --> 00:10:02.850
Is your data type different than you originally
thought?

00:10:02.850 --> 00:10:05.140
With what kind of data do you work?

00:10:05.140 --> 00:10:12.350
How would you publish them to GBIF? (using
which Core and/or extension?)

00:10:12.350 --> 00:10:16.890

00:10:18.320 --> 00:10:23.660
This video is part of a series of presentations
used in the GBIF Biodiversity Data Mobilization

00:10:23.660 --> 00:10:24.950
course.

00:10:24.950 --> 00:10:30.459
The biodiversity data mobilization curriculum
was originally developed as part of the Biodiversity

00:10:30.459 --> 00:10:34.260
Information Development Programme funded by
the European Union.

00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:39.190
This presentation was originally created and
narrated by Sophie Pamerlon with additional

00:10:39.190 --> 00:10:43.300
contributions by BID and BIFA Trainers, Mentors
and Students.
