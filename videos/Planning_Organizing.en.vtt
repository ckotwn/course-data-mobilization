00:00:01.120 --> 00:00:06.529
This session is part of the planning section.
We will be introducing some concepts and methodologies

00:00:06.529 --> 00:00:11.210
that will help you to focus on the organization
of your mobilization project at a number of

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:14.919
levels.
The focus in this session will be on tasks

00:00:14.919 --> 00:00:19.590
and the ways in which they can be organized
in order to prepare practical, workable plans

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:22.320
and clear documentation.

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:29.070
The successful implementation of your project
is dependent in large part on the development

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.271
of realistic, efficient and streamlined processes
and documentation

00:00:33.271 --> 00:00:38.530
This, combined with constant assessment of
changes to the landscape within which your

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:42.969
project exists, will increase drastically
the likelihood of success.

00:00:42.969 --> 00:00:47.899
In this section we will look at three methodologies
for clustering the timing and ordering of

00:00:47.899 --> 00:00:52.739
the tasks and components identified as critical
to the goals of the project

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:57.760
We will then see how good planning is supported
by continuous documentation.

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:04.210
Let’s take a quick look at the definition
of the noun cluster.

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:09.080
It is defined as “A group of similar things
or people positioned or occurring closely

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:10.080
together”.&nbsp;

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:14.030
The three important parts of the definition
for us:

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:15.030
Groups

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:16.030
Similarity

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:17.940
Things

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:22.730
What we will see is that in order to successfully
achieve your mobilization goals, you need

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:28.770
to be able to identify groups and arrangements
of similar tasks, cluster them together and

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:32.820
then string those clusters together in a logical
flow.&nbsp;

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:36.610
In plain terms we will now be looking at the
When and the How of your project

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:44.810
Let’s look first at GROUPINGS.

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:49.040
Probably the most simplest grouping to be
able to identify in your project are Stages

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:52.180
relative to a fixed point in time.

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:57.350
What we mean here is, at what time during
the project should any particular task (or

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:59.130
group of tasks) occur?&nbsp;

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:04.740
The simplest but by no means the only way
of stage-grouping, uses digitization as its

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:10.690
reference point

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:12.400
In this example:

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:17.819
Before - refers to any time before the start
of the digitization effort itself ie the imaging

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:19.870
and transcription;

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:23.769
During - relates specifically to the period
of active digitization; and

00:02:23.769 --> 00:02:28.819
After - is the period after the digitization
effort has ended.&nbsp;

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:33.200
Another common reference point is the start
and end of funding.&nbsp;

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:37.249
You can use anything that makes sense and
even use different reference points for different

00:02:37.249 --> 00:02:41.799
stakeholders and groups of tasks, that run
concurrently.

00:02:41.799 --> 00:02:51.719
These points are often also good places to
insert milestones with metrics into your project.

00:02:51.719 --> 00:02:58.779
The next set of groupings is PMBoK.
PMBoK stands for Project Management Body of

00:02:58.779 --> 00:03:04.279
Knowledge and it is the entire collection
of processes, best practices, terminologies,

00:03:04.279 --> 00:03:09.200
and guidelines that are accepted as standards
within the project management industry

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:13.879
It is overseen by the&nbsp;Project Management
Institute (PMI), which is a global not-for-profit

00:03:13.879 --> 00:03:20.180
member association of Project Managers.
The first edition of the PMBOK Guide was published

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:27.840
in 1996 and it is now on its fifth edition,
which was published in 2013

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:33.150
As a very high level synopsis, the methodology
uses iterative and repeatable groupings to

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:34.519
cluster tasks together

00:03:34.519 --> 00:03:37.459
The stages are:

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:38.469
INITIATING

00:03:38.469 --> 00:03:39.469
PLANNING

00:03:39.469 --> 00:03:40.469
EXECUTING

00:03:40.469 --> 00:03:41.469
MONITORING and

00:03:41.469 --> 00:03:46.889
CLOSING

00:03:46.889 --> 00:03:51.079
Tasks carried out during the initiating phase
should define the new project or the part

00:03:51.079 --> 00:03:55.159
of the project being tracked.
For example obtaining collection permits or

00:03:55.159 --> 00:04:01.379
MOUs before going into the field to collect.

00:04:01.379 --> 00:04:05.569
Tasks carried out during the planning phase
are required to establish the scope of the

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:08.459
project.
For example assessing the physical state of

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:14.950
a collection before pulling specimens for
imaging.

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:19.379
Tasks carried out during the executing phase
are those that accomplish the project’s

00:04:19.379 --> 00:04:27.090
stated deliverables.
For example the transcription of label data.

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:31.620
The monitoring phase is an overarching and
overlapping phase.

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:36.669
The tasks assigned to it serve the function
of watchdog over the planning and executing

00:04:36.669 --> 00:04:45.229
phases, ensuring that performance is on track.

00:04:45.229 --> 00:04:49.890
Tasks in the closing phase indicate that goals
and milestones have been achieved and the

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:57.220
project (or part of the project in question)
have finished.

00:04:57.220 --> 00:05:09.780
This diagram shows the continuous flow and
cyclical nature of the five PMBoK phases.

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:14.150
Task clusters are a defined set of digitization
task groups.

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:19.949
The term was coined by the iDigBio team in
their 2012 paper “Five task clusters that

00:05:19.949 --> 00:05:24.860
enable efficient and effective digitization
of biological collections”.

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:30.130
In the paper the authors identify 5 major
groups of tasks that are most often found

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:35.030
in successful natural history digitization
projects.&nbsp;They are:

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:37.629
pre-digitization curation and staging

00:05:37.629 --> 00:05:39.550
specimen image capture

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:41.830
specimen image processing

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:44.080
electronic data capture and

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:47.889
georeferencing locality descriptions

00:05:47.889 --> 00:05:52.870
Clustering as general concept, is an extremely
useful way to organize the detail of the tasks

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:57.849
which must be carried out during any particular
project stage and divides them up into manageable

00:05:57.849 --> 00:06:03.680
and trackable chunks.

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:09.000
In this diagram of the digitization task clusters
you can see some of the checking and monitoring

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.330
feedback loops seen in the PMBoK method.

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:21.300
The 
next examples of clustering that we will look

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:23.259
at are generally termed “Workflows”.

00:06:23.259 --> 00:06:29.050
Workflows are defined as “the sequence of
processes through which a piece of work passes

00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:33.509
from initiation to completion.”
There are three general categories:

00:06:33.509 --> 00:06:34.509
1) Sequential

00:06:34.509 --> 00:06:35.840
2) Rules Driven&nbsp;

00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:37.900
3) State Machine

00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:43.740
In simple terms they are just another way
that you join tasks and task clusters together

00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:50.020
and apply rules and logic to increase efficiency.
We will look at the three workflows by describing

00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:58.759
in increasing detail, a common digitization
workflow.

00:06:58.759 --> 00:07:03.650
Sequential workflows are simple and represent
a unidirectional series of steps with a single

00:07:03.650 --> 00:07:08.430
start and end point.&nbsp;
The important point being that each task MUST

00:07:08.430 --> 00:07:16.800
be completed before the next one can start.

00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:19.580
In this example the sequence is:

00:07:19.580 --> 00:07:20.900
NAME CHECKING

00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:22.770
Followed by PHOTOGRAPHY

00:07:22.770 --> 00:07:24.280
Then DATA ENTRY

00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:31.229
And finally PROOFREADING

00:07:31.229 --> 00:07:35.930
Rules driven workflows often have an underlying
sequential element as described previously.&nbsp;

00:07:35.930 --> 00:07:48.330
However, within each task cluster, rules and
logic can alter the progress of the workflow.

00:07:48.330 --> 00:07:53.490
In this example in the lower right corner
in the PHOTOGRAPHY task cluster there is a

00:07:53.490 --> 00:07:56.449
quality check logic gate.

00:07:56.449 --> 00:08:01.000
If there is a problem with the image it is
discarded and the specimen goes back to be

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:05.360
photographed again.
Only when the quality check has been passed

00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:11.770
can the workflow continue.

00:08:11.770 --> 00:08:15.880
Machine State workflows are the next most
complex form.

00:08:15.880 --> 00:08:22.199
Here, the steps within each task cluster can
happen asynchronously i.e they are not necessarily

00:08:22.199 --> 00:08:27.169
performed one after another, but instead can
be triggered by actions and states in previous

00:08:27.169 --> 00:08:31.240
steps.
One state is assigned as the start state,

00:08:31.240 --> 00:08:41.040
and then, based on an event, a transition
is made to another state and so on.

00:08:41.040 --> 00:08:47.160
If we take this example from Allard 2012.
Let’s say that the photography lab is only

00:08:47.160 --> 00:08:50.850
allowed to hold 60 herbarium sheets at any
one time.

00:08:50.850 --> 00:08:56.180
The NAME CHECKING task cluster can continue
to prep specimens but there is a check that

00:08:56.180 --> 00:09:01.110
means: Specimens cannot pass to the PHOTOGRAPHY
task cluster until there is space again.

00:09:01.110 --> 00:09:05.880
Meanwhile the other clusters can also carry
on as long as they have specimens or images

00:09:05.880 --> 00:09:13.490
to work on.

00:09:13.490 --> 00:09:18.472
In this next short section, ELEMENTS OF A
GOOD PLAN we will look at how good documentation

00:09:18.472 --> 00:09:21.060
aids good planning. we will:

00:09:21.060 --> 00:09:23.450
highlight the benefits of good documentation;

00:09:23.450 --> 00:09:27.839
make connections between the proposal, planning
and implementation documents;

00:09:27.839 --> 00:09:32.050
and show how the elements of each build together,
thereby reducing the agony of the last

00:09:32.050 --> 00:09:36.790
minute end of project report.

00:09:36.790 --> 00:09:45.740
The definition of a plan is a detailed proposal
for doing or achieving something.

00:09:45.740 --> 00:09:49.320
Documentation of your project should describe
not only what you planned to do but also what

00:09:49.320 --> 00:09:51.290
you actually did.

00:09:51.290 --> 00:09:55.370
Its primary purpose is to communicate with
all stakeholders in order to provide an exact

00:09:55.370 --> 00:10:01.540
account of expectations, responsibilities
and achievements.

00:10:01.540 --> 00:10:05.360
Thorough documentation has many benefits.

00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:10.160
It provides accountability - everyone should
know what they are responsible for and also

00:10:10.160 --> 00:10:12.730
what others are responsible for.

00:10:12.730 --> 00:10:18.300
It ensures integrity - do what you say you
will do, especially where sensitive data is

00:10:18.300 --> 00:10:19.300
concerned.

00:10:19.300 --> 00:10:26.310
It provides protection - a good plan helps
you avoid scope creep and unexpected requests.

00:10:26.310 --> 00:10:30.620
It provides proof of compliance - allows you
to show that you have followed the standards

00:10:30.620 --> 00:10:32.970
that you said you would

00:10:32.970 --> 00:10:38.190
It enhances availability - your plan should
be available, there shouldn't be anything

00:10:38.190 --> 00:10:40.380
hidden at this stage.&nbsp;

00:10:40.380 --> 00:10:45.820
It documents retention - How long will the
data created by this project remain "fresh",

00:10:45.820 --> 00:10:50.120
what needs to happen to keep it up to date.&nbsp;

00:10:50.120 --> 00:10:55.920
It documents disposition - What is the ownership
of the data created by the project? Who will

00:10:55.920 --> 00:10:59.459
be responsible for it after the end of the
project.

00:10:59.459 --> 00:11:07.290
It encourages transparency - openly shared
practical project plans feed back into the

00:11:07.290 --> 00:11:11.780
community and allow others to learn from your
successes and failures.

00:11:11.780 --> 00:11:17.880
And it promotes teamwork - All stakeholders
benefit from knowing how they fit into the

00:11:17.880 --> 00:11:22.199
bigger picture and the more of a sense of
ownership that they, have the more likely

00:11:22.199 --> 00:11:28.110
your project is to succeed.

00:11:28.110 --> 00:11:32.260
All of the resource elements that we have
discussed in the previous section come together

00:11:32.260 --> 00:11:34.269
in the project documentation.

00:11:34.269 --> 00:11:38.551
The elements of your documentation overlap,
let’s have a look at where in the documentation

00:11:38.551 --> 00:11:41.399
cycle each element appears.

00:11:41.399 --> 00:11:49.940
We won’t cover much about the detail of
creating a proposal, except to say that if

00:11:49.940 --> 00:11:52.210
it got you funding then you did a good job.

00:11:52.210 --> 00:11:57.730
The proposal will contain the high-level description
of purpose and rationale and a good faith

00:11:57.730 --> 00:12:02.410
description of a workplan as achievable at
the time of writing.

00:12:02.410 --> 00:12:07.269
The planning document or implementation plan
on the other hand should give everyone involved

00:12:07.269 --> 00:12:12.220
at the start of the project a complete guide
to how the project will actually get done.

00:12:12.220 --> 00:12:15.510
This is where you should include the practicalities,

00:12:15.510 --> 00:12:17.079
workflows for specific goals

00:12:17.079 --> 00:12:19.209
resource allocations to tasks

00:12:19.209 --> 00:12:24.440
milestones and targets

00:12:24.440 --> 00:12:28.990
The planning document should be a living entity
that the project manager revisits regularly

00:12:28.990 --> 00:12:33.519
as they keep track of milestones and approach
checkpoints.

00:12:33.519 --> 00:12:37.610
Workflows should be adjusted and re-documented
as the landscape changes, to make sure that

00:12:37.610 --> 00:12:40.529
interim goals are kept on track.

00:12:40.529 --> 00:12:45.199
If this is done, then Progress reports which
occur at checkpoints throughout the project

00:12:45.199 --> 00:12:49.720
are easy to compile.
Metrics can be reported and any changes in

00:12:49.720 --> 00:12:56.440
the project landscape highlighted for risk
mitigation.

00:12:56.440 --> 00:13:01.079
The compilation of the final report then becomes
the less daunting task of summarizing the

00:13:01.079 --> 00:13:04.779
previous progress reports and the planning
document.

00:13:04.779 --> 00:13:10.079
In a circular fashion your planning document
now can be used in your next project proposal

00:13:10.079 --> 00:13:19.380
and has the benefit of being a tried and tested
successful plan.

00:13:19.380 --> 00:13:23.699
To review, the sections, “Clustering the
Components” and “Elements of a Good Plan”

00:13:23.699 --> 00:13:29.209
we looked at three ways to arrange tasks together
into feasible workflows:

00:13:29.209 --> 00:13:34.110
Groupings –are ways to divide a project
into manageable stages based on specific criteria,

00:13:34.110 --> 00:13:38.540
for example time.
They are helpful ways to determine milestones

00:13:38.540 --> 00:13:43.750
in planning documents and mark progress for
interim reports.

00:13:43.750 --> 00:13:47.670
Task Clusters – were used to describe one
of the most common sets of natural history

00:13:47.670 --> 00:13:50.959
digitization tasks and their ordering.

00:13:50.959 --> 00:13:56.269
While Workflows – where explained as ways
for you to connect tasks and task clusters

00:13:56.269 --> 00:14:02.610
into logical sequences with criteria and logic
to describe the actualities of day-2-day project

00:14:02.610 --> 00:14:04.790
working.

00:14:04.790 --> 00:14:09.600
Lastly we looked at how project documentation
is a continuous process that begins with the

00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:14.370
proposal and should be considered task in
its own right.

Continuous refinement of your documentation
is essential to the successful communication

00:14:18.430 --> 00:14:22.880
of your project at all stages and will help
you and your team know what they should be

00:14:22.880 --> 00:14:25.580
doing at any particular time.

00:14:25.580 --> 00:14:30.100
You will learn more about documentation of
our actual data in further session in this

00:14:30.100 --> 00:14:31.690
course.

00:14:31.690 --> 00:14:43.160
In chapter 4 of the Hobbit, Bilbo and the
unfortunate Dwarves are captured by goblins,

00:14:43.160 --> 00:14:46.899
chained together in the dark and led deep
into the caverns and tunnels of the Misty

00:14:46.899 --> 00:14:48.680
Mountains.&nbsp;

00:14:48.680 --> 00:14:54.310
This may indeed be your first reaction to
starting out on your practical plan, but remember

00:14:54.310 --> 00:14:59.000
that being physically clustered together made
it easier for the dwarves to stay together&nbsp;and

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:03.290
they escaped.
It was by getting detached that Bilbo was

00:15:03.290 --> 00:15:06.440
lost.
Of course he found the ring as result, but

00:15:06.440 --> 00:15:13.760
that’s another story for another time.

00:15:13.760 --> 00:15:18.950

This video is part of a series of presentations
used in the GBIF Biodiversity Data Mobilization

00:15:26.610 --> 00:15:30.600
course.
The biodiversity data mobilization curriculum

00:15:30.600 --> 00:15:35.850
was originally developed as part of the Biodiversity
Information Development Programme funded by

00:15:35.850 --> 00:15:38.480
the European Union.

00:15:38.480 --> 00:15:44.220
This presentation was originally created and
narrated by Sharon Grant with additional contributions

00:15:44.220 --> 00:15:48.869
by BID and BIFA Trainers, Mentors and Students.
