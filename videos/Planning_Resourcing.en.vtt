00:00:01.370 --> 00:00:07.540
This session is part of the planning section.
We will be introducing some concepts and methodologies

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:13.600
that will help you to focus on the organization
of your mobilization project at a number of

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:15.160
levels.

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:21.290
Good planning begins by defining the elements
that will have an impact on your project and

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:24.700
then understanding the interactions between
them.

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:29.290
In this section we will look at the different
players that it is necessary to understand

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:34.390
before you can effectively organize your project
and a methodology to identify WHO the key

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:37.969
players and resources are and WHAT they should
be doing.

00:00:37.969 --> 00:00:50.659
The 5 key concepts we will look at are: Affiliations,
Stakeholders, Roles, Tasks and Goals.

00:00:50.659 --> 00:00:56.579
First let us take a moment to understand the
term Mobilisation.

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:02.539
Mobilisation is the action of bringing resources
into use to achieve a particular purpose or

00:01:02.539 --> 00:01:05.870
goal.
In other words, to mobilize something, whether

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:10.430
it be an expedition to the Antarctic or the
publication of data, you will need to bring

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:16.460
together available resources and assets and
use them to achieve a defined “something”.

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:21.830
To mobilize we must understand our resources.

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:27.700
Let’s break this down this and look at the
first part of the definition of the term mobilize

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:33.470
and dig into what a RESOURCE is.
In the context of biodiversity data mobilization

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:37.610
there are two types of resource.
The hardware that you will need to create

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:44.740
or manipulate digital files (for example computers,
cameras, lights, desks etc) and the people.

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:52.740
The actual individuals who will work with
and for the project.

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:57.610
Specific hardware choices are unfortunately,
outside of the scope of this presentation,

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:02.830
but there are references to existing resources
in the e-Learning platform, that may be helpful.

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:09.000
Don’t be shy to ask your mentors and colleagues
who have done similar projects for help.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.890
In general though, which hardware you need,
depends on both the type of digitization being

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:19.550
carried out (for example herbarium sheets
or pinned insects etc) as well as the combination

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:23.299
of people who will do the digitization and
publication.

00:02:23.299 --> 00:02:29.909
Do NOT fall into the trap of buying equipment
before identifying the people.&nbsp;

00:02:29.909 --> 00:02:34.799
So to the people.
People come in many types and can be organized

00:02:34.799 --> 00:02:40.190
in may ways, and it is the connections between
that will have the most impact on the successful

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:42.549
completion of your mobilization project.

00:02:42.549 --> 00:02:49.830
They can be broadly grouped into 3 levels:
AFFLIATIONS, STAKEHOLDERS and ROLES.

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:54.249
Affiliations are very high level and most
broadly represent the entity that is responsible

00:02:54.249 --> 00:02:57.950
for the management and pay of the team or
individual.

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:01.950
They are often strategic in nature.

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:07.150
Stakeholders are groups or teams who may or
may not be part of a formal management structure.

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:11.569
They share an affiliation and a tactical theme.

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:22.540
Roles in this context, represent jobs or positions
with a title that an individual may hold.

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:27.680
Three affiliations are commonly a part of
the biodiversity data mobilization landscape.

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:33.049
An “INSTITUTIONAL” affiliation usually
accounts for teams who work for the institution

00:03:33.049 --> 00:03:37.209
that is running the project.
In the context of the project they are NOT

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:39.569
specifically paid by the project.&nbsp;

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:46.080
A “PROJECT” affiliation covers those teams
that ARE specifically paid by the project

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:51.730
for any part of their time.

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:56.959
Those teams or groups who do not work for
the institution and are not paid by the project

00:03:56.959 --> 00:04:03.450
specifically, but whose input is required
for success, have an “EXTERNAL” affiliation.

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:07.590
Three often encountered examples of these
are Local Government, Regional Government

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:09.980
and NGOs.

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:14.200
Knowing the affiliations of the teams working
on your project will give you a good idea

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:19.769
of any potentially competing or supporting
strategic goals, priorities, projects and

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:23.680
agenda’s.
It is often at this level that long to medium

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:28.970
term plans and policies come into play, such
as Laws, Intellectual Property Rights, and

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:39.259
Retention Policies which can have a high impact
on your project and its goals.

00:04:39.259 --> 00:04:44.009
Stakeholders represent the next level of the
WHO in your project.&nbsp;

00:04:44.009 --> 00:04:48.650
These are most often the tactical units within
a shared affiliation.

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:53.430
They have responsibility for day to day running
such as managing infrastructure, curating

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:58.530
the collection, doing the research and paying
the bills.

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:01.990
Stakeholders may or may not be part of the
same formal management structure but they

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:07.110
share an affiliation and come together to
do something practical.

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:12.400
It is important to remember that no two affiliations
organize their stakeholder groups in the same

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:21.360
way you should never assume that someone else’s
structure is the same as yours.

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:25.150
Each stakeholder group is made up of one or
more Roles.

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:31.979
Roles in this context represent jobs or positions
with a title that an individual may hold.

00:05:31.979 --> 00:05:36.639
Each of these roles is held by a real person
who will have at least one role.

00:05:36.639 --> 00:05:40.430
It is important to understand how these roles
are distributed across the different stakeholder

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:44.949
groups.
Be aware that a named role at your institution

00:05:44.949 --> 00:05:48.490
may not be in the same stakeholder group somewhere
else.

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:54.100
In some case even though the name of the role
may be the same they may have different responsibilities.

00:05:54.100 --> 00:06:03.050
There is one particular role that we should
spend a little time on.

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:05.009
The project manager.

00:06:05.009 --> 00:06:06.699
This is the person who must:

00:06:06.699 --> 00:06:11.650
Keep track of Scope, Manage, control and mitigate
Change of everything.

00:06:11.650 --> 00:06:16.389
Articulate and keep track of the planning
process by turning high-level information

00:06:16.389 --> 00:06:20.009
into detailed executable plans.

00:06:20.009 --> 00:06:25.900
Follow through on the Management of the project
team so they can meet the project objectives.

00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:29.780
Monitor and control the work of producing
the products, and results that the project

00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:33.870
has committed to and ultimately be responsible
for the Success of the project as measured

00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:38.210
by quality, timeliness and budget compliance.

00:06:38.210 --> 00:06:46.060
The second element of the definition of the
term mobilize is USES.

00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:50.940
These work tasks represent WHICH things you
will need to do, in order to successfully

00:06:50.940 --> 00:06:53.260
do what you said you would do.&nbsp;

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:58.310
The specific set of tasks carried out by the
individuals assigned to the roles and working

00:06:58.310 --> 00:07:02.880
on your project, is dependent on the type
of digitization that you need to do in order

00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:09.449
to create your publishable dataset.&nbsp;
However, they will most likely include some

00:07:09.449 --> 00:07:17.930
or all of the following tasks: Specimen/Object
Staging,&nbsp;Curation,&nbsp;Data Review,&nbsp;Database

00:07:17.930 --> 00:07:28.419
Review, Image Capture,&nbsp;Transcription,&nbsp;Data
Cleaning,&nbsp;Quality Checking, Georeferencing&nbsp;and

00:07:28.419 --> 00:07:30.169
Publishing.

00:07:30.169 --> 00:07:35.629
Once identified, tasks will need to be scheduled
and ordered to be effective.

00:07:35.629 --> 00:07:39.919
There are many way to arrange tasks, some
of course will be more efficient than others.

00:07:39.919 --> 00:07:45.129
We will look more closely at the application
of several methods for manging TASKS for data

00:07:45.129 --> 00:07:48.189
mobilization in the session on ORGANISING.

00:07:48.189 --> 00:07:54.360
These will include: Groupings, Clustering
and Workflows.

00:07:54.360 --> 00:07:59.110
Remember that whilst there is no perfect ”one
size fits all”, digitization activities

00:07:59.110 --> 00:08:02.790
most have been tried at least once by someone
else!

00:08:02.790 --> 00:08:07.939
There are many existing repositories of digitization
protocols available online, and many are included

00:08:07.939 --> 00:08:18.259
in the course resources in the eLearning platform.

00:08:18.259 --> 00:08:24.229
The third and final element of the definition
is&nbsp;the outcome or outcomes.

00:08:24.229 --> 00:08:28.430
GOALS are the “WHAT are you going to do”
of the project, and will have been established

00:08:28.430 --> 00:08:34.919
in the original project proposal.
In fact this is actually the place to start.

00:08:34.919 --> 00:08:40.079
Clearly re-articulating the stated deliverables
of a project and when they are due is the

00:08:40.079 --> 00:08:45.370
critical first step in creating a successful
implementation plan.

00:08:45.370 --> 00:08:49.500
Time should also be spent documenting any
implied goals.

00:08:49.500 --> 00:08:54.280
Whilst these are often more difficult to metricize,
they often speak directly to the sustainability

00:08:54.280 --> 00:09:01.680
of the project and its impact outside of its
target audience.

00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:05.820
Examples of explicit stated data mobilization
goals are:

00:09:05.820 --> 00:09:10.389
Publishing Data to GBIF and doing it regularly;

00:09:10.389 --> 00:09:16.590
Inclusion of additional supporting metadata
over and above the basic fields if available;

00:09:16.590 --> 00:09:21.510
Taking Images of an object/specimen from from
multiple angles, or using advanced techniques

00:09:21.510 --> 00:09:25.430
such as; CT Scanning or Electron Microscopy;

00:09:25.430 --> 00:09:30.870
Imaging all specimens in a collection as opposed
to just of type specimens;

00:09:30.870 --> 00:09:36.070
Georeferencing rather than verbatim transcription
of localities; Creating and Maintaining your

00:09:36.070 --> 00:09:39.430
own IPT.

00:09:39.430 --> 00:09:43.310
More implied but equally important goals include:

00:09:43.310 --> 00:09:46.230
Increased public awareness of local issues.

00:09:46.230 --> 00:09:51.149
The ability to use a successful project as
evidence of capacity and expertise when applying

00:09:51.149 --> 00:09:53.250
for further funding.

00:09:53.250 --> 00:10:02.220
Use of mobilised datasets to effect data driven
policy change.

00:10:02.220 --> 00:10:07.610
You should break down high level implied or
indirect goals into the direct deliverables

00:10:07.610 --> 00:10:09.790
that will move you towards your goals.

00:10:09.790 --> 00:10:15.250
For example if your goal is CAPACITY ENHANCEMENT
then you could have specific achievements

00:10:15.250 --> 00:10:20.290
that may include setting up a regional IPT
that can used by multiple institutions that

00:10:20.290 --> 00:10:26.370
cannot host their own or the training of collections
staff to create and update their own ipt resources

00:10:26.370 --> 00:10:28.900
for publication.

00:10:28.900 --> 00:10:34.130
If the goal is INCREASED PUBLIC OUTREACH deliverables
could include increased visitation to your

00:10:34.130 --> 00:10:40.730
collections web pages or increased number
of observations by locals and citizen scientists.

00:10:40.730 --> 00:10:45.750
In this way it becomes possible to track the
progress of the goal and ultimately report

00:10:45.750 --> 00:10:54.490
on its success.

00:10:54.490 --> 00:11:00.610
Having defined your goals, gathered your resources
and organised your tasks you are now in a

00:11:00.610 --> 00:11:05.160
position to document the landscape and realistically
assess where gaps, bottlenecks and barriers

00:11:05.160 --> 00:11:08.110
may exist in your implementation plan.

00:11:08.110 --> 00:11:13.770
One way to do this is take your list of existing
stakeholders, associate roles to them and

00:11:13.770 --> 00:11:19.610
then assign to each role the tasks that you
have decided they will need to carry out.

00:11:19.610 --> 00:11:24.310
If any stakeholder or role seems to have too
many tasks then this is likely to become a

00:11:24.310 --> 00:11:26.230
bottleneck in your project.

00:11:26.230 --> 00:11:31.130
A task with no assigned role indicates a a
gap.&nbsp;

00:11:31.130 --> 00:11:36.710
Effective early assessment of resources should
mitigate capacity and practical barriers whilst

00:11:36.710 --> 00:11:41.889
identifying competing goals and conflicting
affiliation will help to avoid cultural and

00:11:41.889 --> 00:11:44.640
institutional barriers.

00:11:44.640 --> 00:11:53.240
You will see more on this process in the online
planning exercises.

00:11:53.240 --> 00:11:58.560
In review, good planning begins by defining
the elements that will have an impact on your

00:11:58.560 --> 00:12:02.390
project and understanding the interactions
between them.

00:12:02.390 --> 00:12:07.910
We have looked at the classifications of individuals
and groups of people; and the ways in which

00:12:07.910 --> 00:12:13.130
they interact which each other that may support
or block progress in the completion of your

00:12:13.130 --> 00:12:14.430
project.

00:12:14.430 --> 00:12:20.889
We then briefly discussed the need to identify
the practical tasks that will need to be accomplished.

00:12:20.889 --> 00:12:27.550
Lastly, and arguably most significantly, we
emphasized that a workable implementation

00:12:27.550 --> 00:12:35.949
plan begins with a thorough review of the
goals and deadlines of the project.

00:12:35.949 --> 00:12:40.180
Using the criteria we have discussed you should
now be able to assess the environment that

00:12:40.180 --> 00:12:44.920
your project exists within now in three steps:

00:12:44.920 --> 00:12:49.680
First review your goals.
Do you know exactly what you need to do and

00:12:49.680 --> 00:12:50.810
when?

00:12:50.810 --> 00:12:57.139
Second, research tasks similar to yours.
Has anyone else in the community done a similar

00:12:57.139 --> 00:13:00.209
project?&nbsp;
What did they use?

00:13:00.209 --> 00:13:06.149
Lastly review available resources.
Start with the people.

00:13:06.149 --> 00:13:12.630
Who do have to help you?
Only then see what equipment is already available

00:13:12.630 --> 00:13:17.290
and what you need to buy?

00:13:17.290 --> 00:13:24.399
Hopefully, the proposal project design, and
the landscape in which is was scoped are still

00:13:24.399 --> 00:13:30.399
valid at implementation time.
This should however, never be taken for granted.

00:13:30.399 --> 00:13:31.990
Things change.

00:13:31.990 --> 00:13:35.990
It is often the case that many months (and
sometimes years) will have passed between

00:13:35.990 --> 00:13:40.149
the original submission, funding and project
start.

00:13:40.149 --> 00:13:44.190
The original project staff may even no longer
be involved.

00:13:44.190 --> 00:13:49.880
It is imperative therefore, that the deliverables
as stated in the proposal are reviewed critically

00:13:49.880 --> 00:13:56.670
before implementation, before any hardware
is bought or tasks begun.

00:13:56.670 --> 00:14:00.540
To paraphrase Gandalf in the book The Hobbit,
you don’t need “a mighty warrior” or

00:14:00.540 --> 00:14:06.540
“even a Hero” to kill a dragon; you just
need to “get on and make some plans”.

00:14:06.540 --> 00:14:10.490
Whilst you may find some warriors to fight
your cause, and a hero or two to help you

00:14:10.490 --> 00:14:14.250
out of a problem along the way, you shouldn’t
rely only on them.

00:14:14.250 --> 00:14:19.140
Knowing who the stalwart troopers and quietly
reliable ones in your team is more likely

00:14:19.140 --> 00:14:27.550
to get you to the finish line on time, on
target and within budget.

00:14:27.550 --> 00:14:36.610
