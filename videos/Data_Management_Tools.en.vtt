00:00:01.480 --> 00:00:06.370
In this presentation, we are going to explore
the importance of software tools that can

00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:11.830
help to maintain, clean and standardize your
data.

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:16.390
Data Quality happens at every step in the
data mobilization process.

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:20.570
Within the roles on your team, you should
ensure that someone is responsible and skilled

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:26.060
with data maintenance and manipulation.
We know that real-world data are messy and

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:31.480
transformation and standardization is needed
to make the data easily understandable and

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:33.530
fit for use.

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:38.710
When transforming data (for example merging
columns, converting coordinates, changing

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:43.621
datum, etc), make sure that you document changes
and that you have an original copy that you

00:00:43.621 --> 00:00:48.230
can revert to if necessary.

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:52.530
As was covered in the foundations section,
in choosing tools, some things you should

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:59.410
consider include, price, ease of use, documentation
and support and any technical requirements

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:03.940
to run the tool.
No tool is perfect, the importance is to find

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:09.510
the right balance and the tool that fits your
requirement.

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:14.460
The tools you choose may not be the tools
that others use within your institution – and

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:19.910
that’s just fine, unless your organization
places mandates on the tools you can use.

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:24.320
You need to find and use the tools that help
you to achieve the goals of your institution.

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:29.570
So, you need to build a palette of tools that
will help you and the people with whom you

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:35.150
work to do their work as effectively as possible.

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:40.170
Some of the technical considerations when
choosing tools should include the inputs and

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:46.240
outputs that the tool uses for files.
Does it allow for importing and exporting

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:51.880
standardized delimited files?
Can you select encoding (for example UTF-8)

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:59.160
when opening or saving files to avoid encoding
issues with special characters.

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:03.630
Also in the Foundations section, we introduced
you to a list of software tools compiled by

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:06.710
previous trainers, mentors and students of
this course.

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:11.180
For the remainder of this presentation, we
will review some of the tools that will be

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:18.020
useful to complete the data management exercises
in this course.

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:22.780
When working with data files, you will often
need a text editor that is able to do more

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:28.099
than the default text editor that came with
your operating system, particularly with Windows

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:33.609
and Mac.
Some good options include BBEdit, Notepad++

00:02:33.609 --> 00:02:37.370
and Sublime.
When creating files, you should be consistent

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:43.120
and document your local settings and options.
When opening and editing files, try different

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:51.170
options and check the results to make sure
there aren’t any issues before your proceed.

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:54.800
Here we look at some useful tools for checking
taxonomy within your data.

00:02:54.800 --> 00:03:01.670
The GBIF Name Parser allows you to divide
scientific name into its individual parts.

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:08.749
The Global Names Resolver uses fuzzy matching
to show the accepted taxon or synonym.

00:03:08.749 --> 00:03:12.909
The Catalogue of Life checklist bank offers
a name matching tool.

00:03:12.909 --> 00:03:18.209
It indicates matches found within the checklist
bank to the provided list of names and returns

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:21.810
back the match along with higher taxonomy.

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:26.870
In addition to these tools, there are tools
that deal with specific taxonomic thematic

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:33.080
categories like the iPlant Taxonomic Name
Resoluton and the World Register of Marine

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:36.849
Species

00:03:36.849 --> 00:03:41.040
Often you will find within your datasets,
that coordinates have been stored in the degrees

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:46.569
minutes seconds format (otherwise known as
DMS) and you will need to convert this to

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:52.139
decimal degrees to starndarize the data for
the Darwin Core fields of decimalLatitude

00:03:52.139 --> 00:03:56.480
and decimalLongitude.
You can do this yourself using this mathematical

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:58.349
formula.

00:03:58.349 --> 00:04:09.510
Decimal degrees = (minutes + arc-minutes/60
+ arc-seconds/3600) * hemisphere

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:15.340
Hemisphere longitudinal: west = -1; east = 1

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:22.380
However, there are tools online that can help
you with geoferencing and the conversion of

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:23.380
coordinates.

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:27.560
CRIA’s Species link hosts a variety of data
cleaning tools.

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:33.840
infoXY can help to get locality information
using geographic coordinates.

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:39.030
The Georeferencing Calculator is a tool created
to aid in the&nbsp;georeferencing&nbsp;of descriptive&nbsp;localities&nbsp;such

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:43.630
as those found in museum-based natural history
collections.

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:48.410
Additionally, you may also find Google Maps
or Google Earth useful.

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:53.200
Google Maps contains all of the navigation,
mapping power and points of interest with

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:59.060
just a small hint of satellite imagery, while
Google Earth has complete 3D satellite data

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:05.720
and just a small subset of information on
places, without any point-to-point navigation.

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:09.450
As we do not teach georeferencing in this
course, it is recommended that you review

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:16.380
the Georeferencing documentation, recently
updated by the VertNet team at docs.gbif.org

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:22.570
before completing any large scale georeferencing
project.

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:33.520
Canadensys offers two tools that can help
with both Coordinate and Date conversion.

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:37.170
Operating systems come with their own set
of command line consoles.

00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:43.060
Additionally, many desktop tools provide command
line functionality to be used within those

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:46.030
consoles.
Command line tools are great for scripting

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:50.430
to automate processes.

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:54.980
Remember there are many, many sources for
validating, cleaning and standardizing your

00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:58.010
data.
Until you develop your preferred list of tried

00:05:58.010 --> 00:06:04.090
and trusted tools, remember to explore many
options.

00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:08.280

This video is part of a series of presentations
used in the GBIF Biodiversity Data Mobilization

00:06:14.890 --> 00:06:18.520
course.
The biodiversity data mobilization curriculum

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:23.660
was originally developed as part of the Biodiversity
Information Development Programme funded by

00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:25.800
the European Union.
&nbsp;

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:30.500
This presentation was originally created by
Nestor Beltran with additional contributions

00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:36.460
by Sophie Pamerlon and David Bloom, BID and
BIFA Trainers, Mentors and Students.

00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:39.310
This presentation has been narrated by Laura
Anne Russell.
